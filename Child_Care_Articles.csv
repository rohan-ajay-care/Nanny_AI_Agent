Nanny vs. babysitter: The two job titles may seem interchangeable, but there is a distinct difference between nanny and babysitter responsibilities and hours.

What’s the difference between a nanny and a babysitter?
If you’re looking to hire a caregiver for your child, you might be asking yourself one of the most common questions we get around here: What’s the difference between a nanny and a babysitter?

The thing is, it’s not always clear cut. The key lies in the job description you create for your child’s caregiver, which is then agreed upon by the caregiver you hire.

“I think any child care provider you have in your home should fill the description that you want them to,” says Rachel Charlupski, founder of The Babysitting Company. So it’s most important to be clear from the start on what the job will entail and less so on the actual difference between nanny and babysitter.

There are, however, some general guidelines that can help you decide which term to use — nanny vs. babysitter — to create a job description that will attract a caregiver with your desired qualifications and that will perform the duties your family needs. Using these commonly accepted babysitter and nanny definitions is a good starting point to understanding whom you should hire and how much you should pay them.

Key takeaways
The main difference between a nanny and a babysitter comes down to schedule and involvement: nannies work regular hours and contribute to a child’s long-term development, while babysitters provide short-term, as-needed care. Clear expectations in your job description help ensure you hire the right type of caregiver.
Nannies typically have more responsibilities — such as meal prep, transportation and developmental activities — and often receive benefits like paid vacation. Babysitters focus on immediate supervision and basic care, usually without long-term commitments or added perks.
Costs vary, with babysitters averaging about $21/hour and nannies slightly higher due to consistent hours and broader duties. Understanding these distinctions helps families find a caregiver whose skills, schedule and commitment match their needs.

Nanny vs. babysitter: what’s the difference?
Two of the biggest differences between a nanny and babysitter are their schedules and day-to-day duties. Nannies generally have a set schedule and typically care for their charges everyday or multiple days per week. Babysitters, on the other hand, are used less frequently and are on more of an as-needed schedule.

Nannies also are generally more invested in the overall well-being and upbringing of the kids, where babysitters are hired to provide “here and now” care. Nannies, for instance, will typically work to create an environment that’s comprehensively educational and enriching, where babysitters provide light homework help.

A babysitter is typically someone who temporarily cares for children on behalf of the children’s parents or guardians. A babysitter may also be referred to as a “sitter,” and the most basic job description is that they take care of children of all ages who are in need of supervision on an as-needed basis.

“Babysitters provide for the safety of children for several hours, often with the family members nearby and available by phone,” says Elizabeth Malson, founder of the U.S. Nanny Institute in Sarasota, Florida. “[They’re] usually working for a few hours in the evening or during the weekend.”

“Babysitters provide for the safety of children for several hours, often with the family members nearby and available by phone.”

— Elizabeth Malson, founder of the U.S. Nanny Institute
Most babysitting jobs are considered part-time jobs that are paid by the hour and are either scheduled regularly (e.g., every day after school from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. or every Saturday night) or for special occasions (e.g., New Year’s Eve).

Babysitters are generally responsible for planning activities for your children (like games, sports, arts and crafts), supervising playdates and/or helping get kids ready for bed. They may do some light housekeeping, such as washing dishes or emptying the diaper bin, says Malson.

Some sitters may be willing to take on additional responsibilities for extra pay; those could include cooking, vacuuming, driving children to and from scheduled activities and helping with homework. Ensure that your expectations are clear to any babysitter candidates you interview.

Above all else, a babysitter is responsible for the safety and well-being of your children while in their care.

What is a nanny?
Average hourly rate: $21.45**

Average weekly rate: $858** (based on 40 hours/week)

As for a nanny definition, this is usually someone who is fully invested in a child’s development and well-being. Perhaps the regular gig is the biggest difference between nanny and babysitter. Generally, a nanny will care for children full-time while both parents work. That usually means regular hours and a long-term contract.

“Nannies [tend to] have contracted, consistent work for at least three months, but usually a year or more,” says Malson.

“Nannies [tend to] have contracted, consistent work for at least three months, but usually a year or more.”

— Elizabeth Malson, founder, U.S. Nanny Institute
It’s a nanny’s responsibility to create daily schedules and engage in activities to ensure healthy mental, physical and emotional growth in the children for which they care. Typically, nannies have more responsibilities and duties than a babysitter does.

“Care [by a nanny] includes providing meals and activities for the children and may also include taking the children on outings and providing additional support, such as transporting children to and from school, from school to clubs, sports practices, playdates and other activities,” says Malson. “Nannies work autonomously and may have full responsibility to care for the children when families are out of town.”

Most nannies also will be tasked with preparing meals, helping with household work (e.g., dishes, laundry, etc.) and assisting with homework.

In addition to basic safety classes, a nanny may have had advanced child care training or many years of child care experience. Often, nannies earn a weekly salary (based on hourly expectations), have taxes deducted from their paychecks and work year-round for a family. It’s expected that nannies receive benefits, including at least two weeks of paid vacation and earn holiday pay, as well.

Nannies often become part of the family, bonding with the children in a different way than parents do. Some families consider their nannies co-parents or partners in parenting, getting information from their nannies on their child’s development and interests or asking their nannies to help their kids cope with losses and stress.

Because the job of a nanny is much like that of a parent, most families and nannies work together to create a nanny contract that lays out all terms and conditions of the job, including vacation time, sick days and more.

There are many different types of nannies, depending on whether you’re looking for part-time, full-time, live-in or live-out care. Here are the differences.

Full-time live-out nanny:
Works “full-time” (i.e., five days a week, usually 45 to 50 hours).
Focuses exclusively on child care (e.g., play, bath time, meals, activities, homework, transportation, etc.).
May have extensive training or education in childhood development, which makes them a valuable asset.
May work extra hours or use their own car to help with nanny duties (such as picking up kids from school), both of which will affect their rates.
Gets paid a weekly or salaried rate, which you can negotiate during the initial interview.
Does not reside in the family’s home or perform any non-child-related cleaning or housekeeping.
Full-time live-in nanny:
Shares the same responsibilities as live-out nannies, but they reside in the family’s home.
Receives access to a furnished room, private bath and sometimes a cell phone and a car, in exchange for reduced care costs.
Maintains specific boundaries around work and non-work hours.
Nanny housekeeper:
Handles the same child care duties as a live-in or live-out nanny, but also performs housekeeping duties during nap or quiet time, or while the children are at school.
May charge more (whether hourly or salary) than other nannies because she’s providing additional services.
Part-time nanny:
Cares for kids regularly but for shorter time periods — could be a few hours a week only Monday through Wednesday or only after school.
More involved than a babysitter.
What’s most important is that your child’s caregiver is providing the type and quality of care that’s right for your family.

8 types of nannies you can hire to help
Before you start your search for a nanny, your first step should be to sit down and outline your needs. A nanny can charge varying rates based on their schedule, certifications, and experience, so knowing what you need is key for getting started.

If you’re not 100% sure what type of household help would suit your family best, check out our list of nanny options, which can help you narrow down your search.

1. Nanny housekeepers
Find a nanny

These nannies do it all. They handle all of the child care duties, like a live-in or live-out nanny would, but they also are willing to perform housekeeping duties during nap or quiet time, or while the children are at school.

It’s important to come to an agreement on what kind of housekeeping is required; you want to make sure your nanny housekeeper is doing what you need, but you don’t want them to feel like you’re taking advantage. Make sure their other duties don’t interfere with child care, which is naturally their first priority.

Also keep in mind that a nanny housekeeper may charge more (whether hourly or salary) than other nannies because they’re providing so many different services.

2. Full-time live-out nannies
Find a full-time nanny

These nannies work full time (five days a week, usually 45-50 hours) and their duties focus exclusively on child care (play, bath time, meals, activities, homework, transportation and so on). They do not reside in the family’s home, nor do any non-child-related cleaning or housekeeping. Many full-time nannies are professionals with extensive training or education in childhood development, which makes them a valuable asset. If they are using their own car to help out with nanny duties (such as picking up kids from school) or working extra hours, that will affect their rates, as well. Most full-time nannies are paid a weekly or salaried rate, which you can negotiate during the initial interview.


3. Live-in nannies
Find a live-in nanny

These nannies share the same responsibilities as live-out nannies but reside in the family’s home. Live-in nannies typically have a furnished room, private bath, sometimes a cell phone, and access to a car. Having the nanny live with your family means your care costs are reduced, but be sure to draw specific boundaries about work and non-work hours.

4. Part-time, after-school or summer nannies
Find a part-time nanny

These nannies provide help for parents who only need after-school care, for just a few days during the week, or when school is closed for the summer. Because of their less consistent schedule, it may be more difficult to find this type of nanny. Also keep in mind that these nannies will have less time with the children or in your home, which means that their care will not be as involved as a full-time or live-in nanny. Hourly nannies (which most part-time providers are) may also charge more to account for time they are not needed.

5. Nanny shares
Learn about nanny shares

Sometimes, nannies are open to sharing her services with two families. If you know someone who is also looking for a nanny, talk to them about their needs and their budget for child care. Once you have all that established, you can interview a nanny who is open to or experienced in nanny sharing. This saves money for both families while ensuring quality care from a trained nanny. Keep in mind that there are logistic issues: Where will the nanny go each day? Will you alternate houses? How will you handle paid time off, sick days or when one family doesn’t need her? While there are unique issues to deal with, this is one of the most economical nanny options.

6. College nannies
Find a college nanny

College nannies can be a great resource for many families. These nannies are studying at local colleges and often have a school-friendly, flexible schedule. While they won’t be available full-time hours, they’re close by and are free after school and during the summer. And, if you find a Nursing or an Education student, they may have specific courses or certifications in child care and safety. This type of nanny can also be a great tutor for children. College nannies, because they are only working when they’re not in school, may cost less per hour than part-time or full-time nannies. Keep in mind that these nannies won’t be available forever; they will graduate eventually and you’ll need to find a new nanny.

7. Au pairs
An au pair is a unique child care arrangement, where a young student from a foreign country provides child care and light housekeeping in exchange for room, board and a weekly “stipend.” Au pairs generally stay with a host family for one year and synchronize child care with their school schedules. This is a very affordable option, but keep in mind that it usually requires a full year’s payment upfront. There are also immigration requirements and program expenses related to connecting with your au pair.

Depending on your budget, accommodations and work schedule, there are a number of nanny options. Before beginning your nanny search, consider how many hours a week you’ll need care. Then, decide what other help you need from your nanny, or what you’d like her to provide for your children (i.e. tutoring, transportation, etc.).

Knowing your nanny options should help you find the best child care for your family in no time!

8. Night nannies
Find a night nanny

Night nannies are a great choice for families with young babies. As their title suggests, their role is to help out during night time, namely with getting the baby back to sleep, so mom and/or dad can get more rest. Their shifts usually start anywhere between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. and last between 10-12 hours.

For families with breastfed babies, night nannies will bring baby to mom to nurse and then settle them back down to bed, and if the baby is bottle-fed, a night nanny will take care of feeding and then getting baby back down to sleep. In some cases, night nannies will help with sleep-training, as well.

How do I write a nanny job description and what should I include?
After weighing the pros and cons of a nanny vs. day care and deciding that a nanny is best for your family, your next step is to write a nanny job posting that will land you the perfect nanny. 

“The goal of the nanny job description is to attract the right nanny for your family,” says Elizabeth Malson, former executive director of the U.S. Nanny Association. “Depending on your area, finding a nanny can be tough, so including, and being able to pay, a competitive and fair salary can make a huge difference in attracting ideal candidates.”

Of course, salary shouldn’t be the only thing you cover when writing a job description for a nanny. Here’s what else to include, according to experts.

Key takeaways
To attract the right nanny, write a clear, detailed job description tailored to your family’s specific needs.
Include the job summary, duties, required qualifications and parenting style to ensure a strong match.
Post your listing on nanny websites, social media or through agencies to reach qualified candidates.
How do I write an effective nanny job posting?
According to Lynn Ziefle, a career counselor and former admissions officer at the Nanny Institute, parents should start by determining their child care needs and build from there when writing their nanny position description. “Every family is unique and so child care requirements will also be unique,” explains Ziefle. “Some families need daytime help for young children who are still at home. Others need before- and after-school care. If both parents are working and travel is involved, families may need overnight care.” 


Once you’re clear on the type of child care you need, you can break down your job posting into sections, including:

1. Job summary
According to Lora Brawley, a 30-year nanny veteran and consultant and trainer at Nanny Care Hub in Federal Way, Washington, you want to get “very specific” when writing a nanny job description. 

“The job description is a parent’s best initial screening tool,” she says. “When nannies don’t match, they’ll pass on contacting you. And on the flip side, if a job summary resonates with them, they’ll get excited and jump into the screening process.”

Here’s an overview of what to include in your nanny position description, according to Brawley:

Start date.
Your area (for commuting). 
Wage range.
Benefits offered.
Number/ages of children.
Brief description of your family.
Brief description of your parenting style.
Required qualifications.
Brief description of the type of nanny that would work best with your family.
Documents required (resume, reference letters, etc.).
How to get in contact with you.
2. Duties and responsibilities
When it comes to the duties and responsibilities you want your nanny to undertake, again, be specific. “Providing a list of expected tasks during the nanny shift is important, as well as discussing any household chores, like cleaning the diaper bin or sterilizing bottles,” says Malson.

“Have a section in your job posting where you list all the activities and tasks that need to be completed by the nanny,” Ziefle adds. “By getting specific, you may have fewer applicants, but those who do apply will be a better fit for your family.” 

Every family’s needs are different, so think about what would be most helpful to you and beneficial to your kids. In addition to logistical details, such as driving the kids to soccer practice, Ziefle says to include “some insights into your family dynamics and expectations, which will help you home in on the right fit for your family.”

“If you want a high-energy nanny who plays fitness-oriented games with the children, then share that expectation,” she says. “If you want a nanny who helps the children with after-school homework, then add it to the job description, as well.”

And when you’re done listing the duties, Malson says to go back and re-read it to make sure what you’re asking is reasonable. 

“You can’t potty train, help with homework, cook dinner and get the laundry done in two hours, and neither can a nanny,” she says. “While you want to get as much help as you can, the job and your expectations need to be reasonable and fair.”

3. Qualifications
According to Malson, if you want the nanny to have specific skills or experiences, list them out. Skills and/or qualifications may include:

Certification in CPR and first aid. 
A valid driver’s license, reliable transportation and clean driving record.
Three professional references.
Child care certifications, such as infant care classes and water safety certification. 
Second languages. 
Tutoring skills.
“If certain skills are important to you, they should be included in your listing so you don’t spend time interviewing nannies that aren’t the right fit,” notes Malson.

4. Parenting style
Another thing to consider including in a nanny job description is your parenting style. This, Brawley notes, is a good way to find candidates who gel with you. “For example, if you say you have a respectful parenting style in your job description, nannies who think that’s another way of saying ‘no boundaries’ will skip over you and move on,” she explains. “Conversely, when a nanny loves and practices that approach, they’ll immediately contact you, and they have a much better chance of being a great match for your family.”

Here’s an example of how to include your parenting style in your nanny posting:

We believe in and follow a respectful parenting approach. We’re definitely not perfect, but we’re committed! When Sam is upset, we give him the space and support he needs to share his feelings with us. We work with him to help him manage big feelings that come up and talk about how he can handle things differently moving forward. We don’t use timeouts, rewards, punishments or harsh communication. We use connection and other tools to manage his behavior.

Where should I post my nanny ad?
Once you’ve drafted a solid nanny job description, there are a number of places where you can  post your job. Here are a few to consider:

Social media. Local parenting and child care groups on Facebook are a great place to advertise for nanny help. There’s also a good chance you can chat and/or message with people they’ve previously worked for on the site. 
A nanny agency. Nanny agencies specialize in just that — placing local families with nannies. While all nannies through agencies are pre-screened, vetted and chock full of experience, keep in mind: There’s usually an engagement fee (some as high as $500 or more).
Nanny websites. Sites and apps, such as Care, are a convenient, streamlined way to find quality babysitters, nannies and everything in between.    ",https://www.care.com/c/how-to-write-nanny-job-description-examples/

Nanny website or nanny agency: Which should you use to find a caregiver?
Finding the perfect nanny to care for your little one is never an easy decision. In addition to making sure schedules jive and personalities mesh, there’s a whole host of nanny criteria to consider. But before you even get to that, you need to decide where to start.

Two of the most popular routes are searching for one yourself online, using a nanny website or app, or hiring a nanny agency to find one for you. We asked experts for their insights into these two methods, so that you can decide which one will work best for you and your family.

Nanny website: How they work
Online nanny sites act as a partner in helping you source candidates. While there are a variety of websites and online marketplaces, they differ in what they offer. For the most part, you post a job on their site, either from your mobile phone or home computer, and then they present you with a list of applicants based on your criteria. Then you can contact caregivers for a fee.

Pros of using a nanny-finding website
Easy access to professional nannies. National care-finding sites often list applicants from all over the U.S., giving parents the flexibility of accessing caregivers, even if they are traveling. You also have the option of searching and emailing applicants 24 hours a day — completely online or from the convenience of your mobile phone.
Personal control. Parents who have more time or want to personally choose candidates to interview may prefer an online or app-based option for this kind of control and flexibility.
Affordability. Online nanny sites are a less expensive option for families who can’t afford a full-service nanny placement agency. Online services typically offer subscriptions from one month to one year.
Online screening process for applicants. Many online sites offer criminal and background checks on providers with the subscription fee. Some sites also allow families to post reviews of providers. Learn more at the Care.com Safety Center.
Access to resources and tips. Online sites often provide resources that are similar to the materials that agencies use. For instance, Care.com offers free, online child care guides and articles covering a variety of topics on nannies, ranging from how to interview a nanny, how to handle nanny reference checks, how to create a nanny contract and how to prepare your kids for a new nanny.
A team of caregivers. Nanny websites often let you work with numerous caregivers simultaneously at no extra cost. Maybe you need a nanny during the week and a babysitter every other weekend. Or, maybe you only need an after-school sitter or last-minute backup care. You get more flexibility to work with an unlimited number of caregivers to fit your life’s specific needs.”
Considerations when using a nanny-finding website
Time. Online rates may be inexpensive, but it ultimately boils down to how much time you can invest in the search. Sometimes you may luck out and the first person who emails you is perfect for the position. Other times it may take a little while to weed through the applicants.
Personal research. Many websites’ resources are in the form of articles that parents must search for and read on their own. You may have to figure out the best options for your situation. and the advice that applies.
Expertise. If you’ve never hired a nanny before, you may not know what you’re looking for or where to even start. You can read the articles, but you still may feel like you need more of a helping hand.
Nanny agencies: How they work
Nanny agencies offer a full-service approach to finding caregivers and charge a placement or referral fee for their services. They take care of the entire process from finding candidates to screening them, and they guide parents during the hiring process and offer support after placement.

Pros of using a nanny agency
Simplified hiring process. Agencies often go through a lengthy process of screening applicants, from phone and in-person interviews and resumes reviews to reference checks and background checks. Some even use an assessment exam to analyze an applicant’s knowledge of childcare. “Our process takes many hours: we estimate between 15 and 20 hours per applicant,” says Judi Merlin, CEO of A Friend of the Family Staffing Corporation based in Athens, Georgia “We have found that only 1 in 10 applicants successfully complete our process.”
Ongoing support for parents. Mimi Brady of Westside Nannies, an agency in Beverly Hills and San Francisco, says that one of the best parts of using an agency is the professional tips, tricks and on-going support that is offered. “For example, a full-service agency is able to educate you about topics such as getting your nanny on payroll, offering benefits or perks, and how to maintain a professional, respectful nanny-employer relationship,” Brady says. “Most agencies always provide ears to listen, even after a candidate has been placed, and this can be extremely helpful in working on glitches regarding training your new nanny and miscommunications.”
Backup care options. What happens if your new nanny doesn’t work out? Many agencies will find you a replacement within the first three months. Ask the nanny agency if they provide backup care in the form of temporary nannies to fill in if the first nanny isn’t a good fit. Online services don’t usually replace nannies for free, but with your subscription, you have the option to search and choose another one anytime.
Nanny training and support. Many agencies offer ongoing support for caregivers that can be useful. Your nanny may be eligible for occasional training in things like child development and communication strategies.
“… A full-service agency is able to educate you about topics such as getting your nanny on payroll, offering benefits or perks, and how to maintain a professional, respectful nanny-employer relationship.”

— Mimi Brady, Westside Nannies
Considerations when using a nanny agency
Price. All of these great offerings do come at a price. Prices vary, depending on things like location, but for reference, at Westside Nannies, there’s a $500 engagement fee required before you begin your search, and there’s also a placement fee, which is about 18% of the nanny’s annual salary. In some cases, nanny agencies can charge up to $4,000. You should discuss the agency’s fee structure early in the process so you aren’t surprised by upfront registration fees, placement fees when you hire a nanny or additional charges later on down the road.
Handing off control. While agencies take care of the searching, screening and qualifying of potential candidates, some parents prefer to be in control of the entire process themselves.
Refund policies. Before you sign on the dotted line, check what the nanny agency’s refund policy is — if there even is one. Some agencies only replace nannies and only for a short period of time. Ask about different “what-if” scenarios and make sure you’re comfortable with the fine print.
The bottom line
There is no one right way to find a nanny. One option is not better than the other. It is all about what the parent is looking for as far as support, personal control and flexibility over their search, and what their budget is. Pick the one that works best for your needs and your budget.",https://www.care.com/c/deciding-between-a-nanny-finding-website-and-a-nanny-agency/

Where should I look for a nanny?
Finding a nanny for your child is an undertaking, to say the least. And while options can be a good thing, the numerous resources available to help with the search can feel overwhelming, not to mention time-consuming or even cost-prohibitive.

“From conducting a do-it-yourself search to hiring a reputable, experienced nanny agency to do a search for you, there are a number of ways to find a nanny,” notes Michelle LaRowe, lead educator at Global Nanny Training. And while there’s not a one-size-fits-all way to search, ultimately, LaRowe notes, you, as the parent, “need to know and feel comfortable with who will be caring for your kids.” 

Here, LaRowe and other experts share how to find a nanny, considerations to make during your search and useful tips to make sure you hire the perfect caregiver for the job.

Key takeaways
When it comes to finding a nanny, parents have several options, including using Care.com, social media groups, nanny agencies and college job boards.
Safety is the most important consideration when looking for a nanny. Candidates should be willing to provide references, background checks and verification of their credentials.
A nanny agency may be the most costly way to find a nanny, but using social media, online platforms and websites can be the most time-consuming.
When deciding how to find a nanny, pick the option that best aligns with your budget, unique needs and schedule.

The 5 best options for finding a nanny

1. Online platforms and websites
For many families, particularly those new to an area (or parenthood, in general), child care websites, such as Care.com, are a go-to place to find a nanny. The reason being, notes Kristen Szapka, president and founder of A Nanny Match in New York City, they’re “ideal for a cost-effective introduction to a wide selection of candidates.” Put another way: You get bang for your buck. 

“For parents who want a do-it-themselves approach and to cast a wide net when searching for a nanny, using a website to source applicants may make sense.”

— Michelle LaRowe, nanny educator
Through Care.com, you can access local nanny profiles and post a job. Individual caregivers on Care.com start with a required background check, with additional checks available for purchase.

That being said, Szapka notes, “parents should still expect to thoroughly interview candidates and check references.” It’s also important to perform a comprehensive background check before hiring.

Best for: Saving money while loading up on options. “For parents who want a do-it-themselves approach and to cast a wide net when searching for a nanny, using a website to source applicants may make sense,” LaRowe says. “What costs you in time to sort through dozens of caregivers in your area saves you in financial investment.” 

Considerations: In order to access all the features on Care.com, there may be an additional cost. Also, you need to take on the overall task of searching, which can be time-consuming.

2. Nanny agencies
Unlike child care platforms, nanny placement agencies do the searching for you via their network of pre-screened nannies. “Reputable nanny agencies source and recruit professional full-time or part-time caregivers and have established networks of vetted candidates,” explains Szapka. “Agencies come with higher costs but offer expertise and save time.”

 “Agencies come with higher costs but offer expertise and save time.”

— Kristen Szapka, nanny agency founder
For parents who want to leave the searching to the experts, LaRowe recommends using an agency that is a member of the Association of Premier Nanny Agencies (APNA) or International Nanny Association (INA) to ensure quality. 

Best for: Parents who have the money, but not necessarily the time for finding a nanny. “What you save in time and energy, costs you in financial investment,” notes LaRowe. “Quality agencies vet applicants so parents can focus on fit and ensure they find the right match.” Additionally, she adds, agencies typically “offer some type of replacement policy should things not work out, serving as a way to protect your investment.”

Considerations: The cost. “Parents have to be willing to spend thousands of dollars to hire a candidate through an agency,” notes LaRowe.

Another thing to consider when going the agency route, says LaRowe, is the level of formality. She notes: “Some agency nannies may be more professional than you’re seeking and require more formal arrangements with benefits and other perks you may be unfamiliar with as industry standards.”

3. Social media parenting groups
Practically every area has local parenting groups on social sites like Facebook and Nextdoor. These spaces can be a great place to go for nanny leads, suggestions and ideas. 

“These spaces can be good for community recommendations,” Szapka notes. “But exercise caution and conduct thorough vetting, as these are informal networks.”

For Rebecca Alwine, a mom of three from Augusta, Georgia, Facebook wound up being the perfect resource for finding a nanny for her unique situation of time requirements, location and pay. She didn’t need full-time care, and she needed a nanny who could watch her children in the nanny’s own home — and none of the major child care sites turned up viable options.

Then she turned to a local Facebook mom’s group — and that’s where she found her family’s first two nannies. She interviewed the nannies, both with and without her children present. She also made sure to tour the nannies’ homes and observe any other children, pets and adults who were around. Lastly, she checked in with all of the candidate references. 

When it comes to how to find a nanny, Alwine feels that “working through a network is the most efficient way to find someone you can trust.”

Best for: Parents who want to utilize social connections and connect with caregivers in their community. 

Considerations: You need to be wildly vigilant. “Social media groups are home to numerous scammers and even the most careful parent can fall victim to connecting with someone who isn’t who they appear to be,” states LaRowe. 

4. Colleges and universities
Colleges and universities can be a “resource for finding educated, part-time help,” Szapka says. You can find students looking for work through local Facebook groups, search for college nannies through a site like Care.com or post directly to university job boards. 

“When using a college student, make sure you run proper checks and ensure clear communication about schedules and commitments,” Szapka says. Many college students are in need of work, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re qualified to care for kids. 

“When using a college student, make sure you run proper checks and ensure clear communication about schedules and commitments.”

— Kristen Szapka
Melina Zahalka, a single mom of two from Bellingham, Washington, encountered this issue when she started her search using a student, off-campus employment page at the university where she worked. She deemed the results OK, but ultimately unsatisfactory.

“Most were desperate for employment, and while they had kid experience, I was unsure of how much because it had often come in the form of short-term internships and volunteer work,” Zahalka says. Eventually, she found a nanny through the recommendation of a friend. 

Best for: College students are best for parents “seeking a casual or short-term nanny who is flexible and affordable,” LaRowe notes. In other words: University students may be better suited for babysitting or after school a few days a week, if it works with their schedule.

Considerations: The schedule. In addition to the experience piece, it’s important for families to keep student schedules in mind — not only can they be unpredictable, they’re best-suited for short-term commitments. “With the changing schedule of a college student,” LaRowe says, “it’s not always ideal for finding long-term care.”

5. Friends
For many families wondering how to find a nanny, going through friends is the first option that comes to mind. (Who hasn’t sent a group text when in need of… just about anything?). 

“Friends and word of mouth are one way to find nannies,” Szapka says. “And there’s trust in personal endorsements. However, the pool of candidates may be limited, and what may work for one family may not work for another.”

After Zahalka decided that a college student wasn’t the best choice, she reached out to her neighbor, who then invited her to meet her own nanny, Aimie. “I chatted with Aimie when she was at the neighbor’s watching their son,” Zahalka says. “She was bright, enthusiastic, unafraid to jump in and help buckle/unbuckle car seats and quirky and fun — clearly comfortable around kids and parents.”

Zahalka knew right away that Aimie was the one, and she hired her on the spot. Because of Aimie’s existing relationship with the neighbor’s family, they often shared the cost of child care, which was an added bonus. “She was integral in getting my small children from infancy to preschool and kindergarten,” Zahalka says. “I couldn’t have been a single mom without her.”

Best for: Parents who want a personal reference. “For parents who want peace of mind knowing a nanny has a good track record they learned about through personal recommendation, word-of-mouth referrals may seem best,” says LaRowe.

Considerations: Personal recommendations don’t necessarily equate a good fit. “Just because a nanny was right for your friend, doesn’t mean she’ll be right for you,” LaRowe explains. “Every family does things differently and has different priorities and values. What your friend loved about their nanny may be your worst nightmare, and having to fire the nanny that your friend recommended is sure to be awkward, to say the least.”

What precautions do I need in keep in mind when finding a nanny?
No matter where you search for nannies, safety should always be top of mind. Here, precautions to keep in mind when searching for and hiring a nanny, per LaRowe and Szapka:

Verify nanny or agency credentials.
Check for compatibility (read: go beyond what’s on paper).
Conduct thorough background checks. 
Check references. 
Trust your gut.
One final tip on how to find a good nanny
There are a number of ways to find potential nannies, all with their pros and cons. The key is to feel out a few options and decide which route(s) are best for your budget and schedule. 

“In a world where anything from groceries to a new car can be delivered to your home on demand, it can be tempting to simply put your request for a nanny into the atmosphere and welcome the first caregiver who lands at your door,” LaRowe says. “But don’t. A little work goes a long way.”",https://www.care.com/c/how-to-find-a-nanny/

How much does a nanny cost?
If you’ve narrowed down your choice of child care options and decided that hiring a nanny is the right option for your family, you’re probably wondering: How much does a nanny cost? As with any child care option a parent considers, it’s crucial to know up front what it may cost so you can look at your budget and plan accordingly.

Key takeaways
Hiring a nanny typically costs U.S. families around $827 per week or $20.68 per hour for one child, though rates vary significantly based on location, experience, duties and number of children.
Additional expenses like nanny taxes, payroll services, background checks and overtime can add to the total cost.
To budget effectively, families should research local rates, consider specific job expectations, and factor in both direct and indirect costs.
How much is a nanny?
U.S. parents posted nanny rates averaging $827 per week, or about $20.68 per hour, for one child, according to the Care.com 2025 Cost of Care Survey. You can find the most current posted nanny rates, depending on location and number of children, by entering your city and state into our Cost of Care Calculator. But there are several other factors to keep in mind when discussing the proposed cost of a nanny.

U.S. parents posted nanny rates averaging $827 per week, or about $20.68 per hour, for one child, according to the Care.com 2025 Cost of Care Survey.

What should I factor into a nanny’s pay rate?
The expected cost of hiring a nanny has many variables, including where you live, what the nanny is hired to do and how much experience they bring to the position.


Geographic area
One of the biggest factors in how much you’ll pay for a nanny is where you live. Hourly asking rates for nannies can vary widely from one community to the next. Those living in areas with a higher cost of living generally pay more for nanny services than in lower-priced areas. Competition can also be a factor. Cities with fewer experienced, well-qualified nannies may have higher asking rates than in places where competition isn’t quite so fierce.

Here are some examples of posted nanny asking rates based on location, according to recent Care.com data.

Current posted nanny rates in top U.S. cities*
City, State Hourly Nanny Rate
Atlanta, Georgia  $21.49/hr
Brooklyn, New York  $24.34/hr
Charlotte, North Carolina $20.67/hr
Chicago, Illinois $22.18/hr
Denver, Colorado  $23.30/hr
Houston, Texas  $19.73/hr
Orlando, Florida  $19.23/hr
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  $21.52/hr
Phoenix, Arizona  $20.68/hr
Portland, Oregon  $22.71/hr
San Antonio, Texas  $17.80/hr
San Diego, California $23.33/hr
San Francisco, California $28.82/hr
Seattle, Washington $26.72/hr
Tampa, Florida  $20.16/hr
Washington, DC  $22.59/hr
*Based on average posted starting rates from nannies listed on Care.com, as of September 19, 2025
Beyond cost of living, commuting can also play a role in nanny cost, says Emily Dills, CEO of Seattle Nanny Network. For instance, if the nanny has to commute, Dills says, “the nanny will be taking into consideration the cost of her time in transit and mileage, especially if the hours are part time.”

What’s the difference in cost between a part-time and full-time nanny?
The main difference between a part-time nanny and a full-time nanny is the number of hours they work. Generally, a part-time nanny works for 35 hours a week or less, whereas a full-time nanny usually works 40 hours a week. That means, the expected cost difference between hiring a part-time and a full-time nanny can be pretty significant.

Here’s an example of the cost comparison between a part-time nanny and a full-time nanny, based on the posted average nanny rate of $20.68 per hour ($827 per week) from the 2025 Cost of Care Survey:

Hourly Rate*  Weekly Rate
Part-time nanny 
(15 hours a week) Weekly Rate
Part-time nanny 
(20 hours a week) Weekly Rate
Part-time nanny 
(30 hours a week) Weekly Rate
Full-time nanny 
(40 hours a week)
$20.68/hr $310.20/wk  $413.60/wk  $620.40/wk  $827.20/wk
In addition to where you live, what you’re asking the nanny to do could also affect how much you’ll pay. Caring for more children, for example, usually means more work for the nanny, and therefore, a higher asking rate.

The specific tasks included in the job description of a nanny can change from one family to the next, says Los Angeles parent coach and nanny matchmaker Stella Reid. “[Hiring a nanny] is about making a family’s life easier,” Reid says. That can mean “things like party organization, grocery shopping, organizing, planning schedules — it can be a lot of hats for one person.

Looking up average posted nanny rates in your area is a good starting place — you can always go up or down based on expected duties or nanny’s experience.

Types of duties and tasks
Circumstances that might make the proposed rate of nanny services go up or down include:

Number of children.
Ages of children.
Driving to and from activities — typically covered in the form of using a household vehicle or paying the nanny a mileage reimbursement if they have to use their own car.
Household tasks, such as cooking, laundry, cleaning or dog-walking.
Errands like grocery shopping or picking up the dry cleaning.
Managing contractors or other household employees.
Event planning.
How much more a nanny should earn for these non-child-care tasks is between the family and the nanny, Reid says, and it should be something that’s discussed during routine pay assessments and written down in a nanny contract or worker agreement.  

For those at a loss for what would be appropriate, however, Gabriela Gerhart, founder and president of Motherhood Center in Houston, said in a prior interview with Care.com that it’s fairly standard to tack $1-2 onto the proposed hourly rate for common household tasks like meals or laundry for the whole family.

Experience and background of the nanny
If families are looking for someone with a lot of training or background in a specific area, they should be prepared to pay more for that experience.

“Nannies with a bachelor and master’s degree, especially related to early childhood education, typically have a higher earning potential,” says Michelle LaRowe, lead educator at CACHE-accredited Global Nanny Training. Nannies with specialized training or experience with niche circumstances, such as caring for multiples or children with special needs, also earn more.

Should I expect extra costs that aren’t included in a nanny’s pay rate?
Your proposed nanny pay rate is only part of the equation. When you’re budgeting for nanny services, you should also take into consideration other costs, like nanny taxes, background checks and supplemental care when your nanny is sick or on vacation. These additional expenses include:

Nanny taxes
According to the Internal Revenue Service, nannies (full-time or not) are employees — not independent contractors — meaning families are responsible for not only withholding state and federal taxes for the nanny, but also covering the costs of taxes typically paid by other kinds of employers. For tax year 2025, “nanny taxes” kick in when a nanny makes more than $2,800 in a calendar year, and how much taxes are varies by location. If you aren’t sure how much nanny taxes are in your state, this nanny tax calculator can give you an idea of what you’ll need to pay. Note: These taxes apply even if you hired your nanny through an intermediary, like a service or website.

Payroll services
Some families opt to use a payroll service or accountant to manage the nanny’s paycheck and nanny taxes, which can also be an added cost.

Intermediary agencies
If you hire a nanny through a referral agency or nanny service, these organizations will generally charge fees to vet and recommend nannies for you.   

Periodic background checks
Background checks for nannies prior to hiring them on, as well as on an annual or routine basis, are also an added cost. Typically, the more in-depth the background check, the higher the fee. Note: Care.com requires every individual caregiver on our platform to a complete a Care.com Background Check. While our Care.com Background Check is a good place to start, it does not replace the safety precautions that families should take on their own.

To learn more about background checks and safety, visit the Care.com Safety page.
Additional certifications
Families insisting that their nannies be up-to-date on CPR and first aid certifications will often pay for them to be renewed every few years.

Raises, bonuses and overtime
Like many different types of employees, nannies expect to receive routine raises and/or bonuses and are entitled to overtime pay (time and a half) if they work more than 40 hours per week, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. How much you should give in raises or bonuses is between you and your nanny, but LaRowe says a 2-3% cost-of-living raise, in addition to a 5-7% merit increase, is fairly standard.

Supplemental child care
Many families choose to give their nannies paid sick leave or vacation days. During that time, families might need to pay for supplemental, short-term child care, such as an emergency babysitter or drop-in child care, if family members are unable to fill in.  

In the end, here’s the takeaway on the cost of a nanny
How much a nanny costs can differ widely from one family to the next, based on circumstances, expectations and experience levels. Families interested in hiring a nanny should start by looking into the posted rates of nannies in their area and taxes for their state, and then adjust their budget from there.

How much does a live-in nanny cost?
When it comes to hiring a live-in nanny, there are a number of things to consider. First and foremost, you need to decide if having a live-in nanny is right for your family. After that (and after finding the right person), you need to determine an acceptable live-in nanny salary. But spoiler alert: The latter decision shouldn’t be all that difficult, as the cost of a live-in nanny doesn’t differ much from the cost of a live-out nanny.

“Whatever the market rate is for live-out nannies in your area, you can expect to pay the same, or a few dollars more per hour, for a live-in nanny,” says Michelle LaRowe, lead educator at Global Nanny Training. “And like live-out nannies, live-in nannies must be paid an hourly rate at or above minimum wage, though most nannies expect far more.” 


“Whatever the market rate is for live-out nannies in your area, you can expect to pay the same, or a few dollars more per hour, for a live-in nanny.”

— Michelle LaRowe, nanny educator
From taxes to overtime, here’s everything you need to know about live-in nanny costs.

How much should I pay a live-in nanny?
The cost of a live-in nanny is on par with the cost of a live-out nanny — or, as LaRowe says, a few dollars more per hour. While a number of factors will influence a live-in or live-out nanny’s rate (more on this shortly), Olivia Fountain, operations manager at the domestic staffing agency, Household Staffing, notes that the live-in nannies who are placed through their company generally make between $25-$30 an hour, with their working hours generally being from around 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. or 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The company places nannies nationally, but it’s worth noting they generally work with higher-income families.

To get a better idea of what live-in nannies in your area are asking, use our Cost of Care Calculator. As a quick example, as of February 3, 2025, the average posted cost of a live-in nanny in Brooklyn, New York is about $24.62 an hour, while the average posted cost of a live-in nanny in San Antonio, Texas is around $18.43.

Here are some examples of the posted live-in nanny prices based on location, according to recent Care.com data.

Current posted live-in nanny rates in top U.S. cities*
City, State Hourly Nanny Rate
Atlanta, Georgia  $21.80/hr
Brooklyn, New York  $24.62/hr
Charlotte, North Carolina $20.54/hr
Chicago, Illinois $22.46/hr
Denver, Colorado  $23.88/hr
Orlando, Florida  $20.07/hr
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  $21.26/hr

Seattle, Washington $26.93/hr
Washington, DC  $23.64/hr
*Based on average posted starting rates from live-in nannies listed on Care.com, as of November 21, 2025.
Other factors that can influence the cost of live-in nanny services (live-in or live-out) are:

Years of experience.
Number of kids.
Ages of kids.
Expected duties. 
Live-in vs. live-out nanny cost: How they compare
A live-in nanny salary may be on par with a live-out’s, but there are a few differences to keep in mind. For one, in addition to their salary, you’re including “room and board” (which means you need a clean, safe, suitable place for them to live). While, technically, you can deduct a small amount for this, LaRowe notes that “most nannies will not look favorably on essentially paying a family for employment” — and in some places and instances, it’s illegal.  

In Massachusetts, for example, employers are not allowed to deduct room and board from a household employee if the job requires them to live in your home. If the nanny wants to live in your home, but is not required, you can deduct $35 (at most) a week. 

“Many people are under the impression that live-in nannies earn less than their live-out counterparts — this simply is not true,” explains LaRowe. “Live-in nannies are typically paid a premium because of the flexibility and reliability they bring to the table. While it is often assumed that by deducting room and board, parents can save by hiring a live-in nanny, in practice, that just isn’t the case.”

“Many people are under the impression that live-in nannies earn less than their live-out counterparts — this simply is not true. Live-in nannies are typically paid a premium because of the flexibility and reliability they bring to the table.”

— Michelle LaRowe
Each situation is different, but other expenses that may accompany a live-in nanny are:

Food.
Cell phone.
Higher utility bills.
Car.
Worker’s compensation insurance coverage. 
Are live-in nannies paid overtime?
Live-in nannies must be paid for every hour worked — “including times they are not allowed to leave the home or are on call,” according to LaRowe — but in most states, due to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), live-in nannies are not entitled to overtime pay.

“However,” LaRowe adds, “in some states, live-in nannies are entitled to overtime if they exceed a set number of hours per day or week.” 

For instance, in Hawaii , live-in employees are to be paid overtime for anything over 40 hours a week, whereas in New York, live-in nannies are to be paid overtime if they work over 44 hours in a week. 

Other states have their own live-in nanny overtime rules, as well. To find the most up-to-date information, check out our list of nanny tax and payroll requirements by state. 

What are live-in nanny work hours?
Live-in nanny hours are generally the same as live-out nanny hours. While a live-in nanny undoubtedly offers more convenience than a live-out, they’re not “on 24 hours a day,” notes Fountain. Each family and live-in nanny need to decide what works best for them and put it in their nanny contract. 

Fountain also notes that, generally, live-in nannies don’t get up with babies during the night, as their tasks are more aligned with a live-out nanny than a night nanny. 

Do I pay live-in nanny taxes?
Yes! Families are required to withhold taxes from household employees that earn over $2,800 in a year, in addition to paying household employment taxes of their own.

Cost: How much you can expect to pay a nanny,6 ways to cut the cost of hiring a nanny,"6 ways to cut the cost of hiring a nanny
Hoping to make the nanny price tag more affordable for your family? Here are a few ideas for negotiating a lower rate and saving money elsewhere.


6 ways to cut the cost of hiring a nanny
You’ve looked over your child care options, and you’re pretty sure getting a nanny is the best choice for your family. The thing is: It’s not cheap.

According to the Care.com 2024 Cost of Care survey, U.S. parents posted nanny rates for one child at an average of $766 per week — more than two times the average cost of a child care center and family care centers. The higher price tag leaves some families asking: How can I make hiring a nanny more affordable?

How much you pay for a nanny depends on a wide variety of factors, some of which can provide opportunities for negotiating lower rates or saving money elsewhere. And nanny contracts are highly customizable, so there are many ways to tailor an arrangement that works for everyone.

Here are a few ways you can save money while hiring a nanny.

1. Get in on a nanny share
One way families can save costs on nanny services is to pair up with another family and share a nanny. Nanny shares allow families to have a lot of the benefits of having a nanny — personalized, attentive, home-based child care — without having to pay full price for one.

That’s what Austin mom Darla Cameron decided to do. When she got pregnant with her first child, she was living near downtown Washington, D.C., where child care was scarce.

“Instead of scrambling to get on a waitlist right after I found out I was pregnant — which we knew might not work out — we decided to do a nanny share with our close friends who had a baby about a month after us and lived about a mile away,” Cameron says.

It’s a popular tactic, says Michelle LaRowe, lead educator at NannyTraining.com and author of “Nanny to the Rescue!,” especially for families looking to save money.

Sharing a nanny, however, doesn’t split the price of a nanny in half, she cautions. Nanny share setups are a lot more work for the nanny. They essentially have two different employers, and that can complicate things. As a result, nannies tend to charge more in nanny share setups than with individual families. But because families split the costs, it still ends up being less — about two-thirds the costs, LaRowe says — than if they had hired their own nanny.

2. Consider offering additional benefits in exchange for lower pay rates
Colorado mom Giorgianna Venetis-Colon knew sending her twins to a child care center would cost upwards of $3,000 a month — if they could even get in. Waitlists for two infants were a year and a half long, she says, so they opted for a nanny instead. She worked with her nanny to negotiate a lower rate, in exchange for additional employment benefits — in her case, more paid time off and allowing the nanny to bring her grandson to work with her.

In the end, Venetis-Colon ended up paying hundreds of dollars less than she would have paid for two spots at a traditional day care center.

3. Choose a nanny with less experience or fewer qualifications
Nannies with bachelor’s or master’s degrees or other certificates or specialized training are able to charge more for their services, LaRowe says. But nannies who don’t have a long list of degrees can still provide high-quality care. Families should ask themselves what their most important qualifications are in a nanny and determine what they are willing to pay more for, as well as what they can live without.

4. Take advantage of tax benefits
Many companies now offer employees dependent care flexible spending accounts (FSA) as part of their benefits packages. These accounts allow you to put up to $5,000 pre-tax in them. You can then use that tax-free money to pay for dependent care expenses like a nanny. A good estimate for how much you can save with this FSA is $2,000.

If you don’t have access to an FSA, you can still get tax breaks through federal child care tax credits. These credits often let you save up to $600 in child care expenses (for a single child), or $1,200 (for two or more children) on your tax return.  

Either (or both) of these tax breaks could help save you hundreds — if not thousands — of dollars a year in federal income tax savings.

In the end, the amount of money you’ll save might work out to be pennies on the dollar you spend on child care, but it can help offset at least some of the costs associated with hiring a nanny, says Amy Matsui, director of income security at the National Women’s Law Center.

“Because child care is so expensive, families need all the help they can get,” she says. “The [child care] tax credit can play a role in making your money work smarter.”  

Check out the nanny tax calculator to find out what tax breaks might look like for your family.

5. Adjust your schedule
If you really love a nanny but aren’t sure you can pay their requested rate, you may need to get creative on your end. If the nanny is open to fewer hours and there’s flexibility on your end, work with your partner, employer or a family member to adjust schedules so you can reduce the number of hours your nanny will be needed.

Maybe you and your partner offset your work schedules by a few hours in the morning and in the late afternoon, so one of you leaves earlier and comes home earlier while the other leaves later and comes home later. Or maybe a family member can do the few hours after school and before you arrive home from work. Arrangements like these can trim two to four hours a day off the hours you need child care.

6. Consolidate outsourcing
Another common way families work to lower costs overall is to look at what other services they may be already paying for, such as house cleaning, and asking the nanny if they are comfortable taking on some of those responsibilities for an additional fee. LaRowe says consolidating what families outsource into a single role — such as a nanny-housekeeper or simply a “household manager” — can help reduce costs overall.

This situation works best, she says, when the children’s schedules offer breaks in the day when the nanny can focus on other tasks, such as when kids go to school or take long naps.

Potential services some families outsource that could be offered to a nanny include:

Meal prep.
House cleaning.
Dog walking.  
Tutoring.
Grocery shopping.
Think outside the box to trim costs where you can. Every little bit counts.

Do nannies get overtime?
A common question when families hire a caregiver is: do nannies get paid overtime? The quick answer: yes. But according to the most recent INA Salary and Benefits Survey, 32% of nannies say they don’t receive overtime pay. That leaves a lot of nannies short-changed or paid off-the-books for their overtime work.

Working overtime is a difficult task for anyone but especially for nannies with families of their own. Whether you’re hiring a nanny or you are a professional nanny, here’s what you need to know about overtime pay:

Why do nannies get overtime pay?
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) classifies all employees as either exempt or non-exempt workers when it comes to overtime. In the case of domestic employees like nannies and babysitters, the type of work they do makes them a non-exempt worker, meaning families cannot refuse to pay them overtime. And that holds true whether a nanny or sitter is full time or part time.

How much overtime should nannies be paid?
If a nanny works more than 40 hours over the course of seven days, they are required to receive 1.5 times their normal hourly rate for each overtime hour they work.

What about a live-in nanny?
For live-in nannies, most states don’t require overtime pay — though a few states (California, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York and Oregon) have more specific laws.

Learn more about what a live-in nanny costs.

How should you keep track of overtime?
For any nanny who regularly works more than 40 hours a week, set up a system to keep track of hours — so both the employer and child care provider know how much the nanny should be paid. You can use a time-tracking app or set up a shared spreadsheet using Google Drive to keep the nanny’s time on the clock organized. Then, come pay day, add up the extra hours and the time-and-a-half rate.",https://www.care.com/c/do-nannies-get-overtime/

What questions should I ask when interviewing a nanny?
You’ve vetted your list of nanny applicants, picked your favorites and scheduled the interviews. What next? Now, it’s time to draft your nanny interview questions list so that you cover all your bases and find the best nanny for your family.

While you want the conversation to unfold organically, it helps to have a few questions to ask a potential nanny so you can get a feel for their level of experience and care style. You also need concrete answers to important aspects of the position. The in-person interview is often the last step in the hiring process, so be thorough. To make the interview easier, you can use this list of sample nanny interview questions.  

Key takeaways
Once you’ve chosen your top nanny candidates, prepare key interview questions to assess their experience, caregiving style and fit with your family.
Keep the conversation natural but focused.
Avoid illegal questions and prioritize finding someone who meets your needs.
What basic questions should I ask a nanny during the interview?
Start any nanny interview by getting to know the candidate. As a basic indicator, make sure that your conversation is flowing naturally and that they are giving you sufficient answers. You don’t want one word answers, but you also don’t need their entire life story.

You can start the interview by asking basic background questions like:

How long have you been caring for children?
What age groups have you cared for?
What is your favorite age to care for? Why?
Do you have other work or life experience that helps you as a nanny?

Explore the discussion here if you want, but these should be fairly straightforward answers.

What training and education questions should I ask?
The best part about hiring a nanny is that they are highly qualified child care providers. Make sure you dive into what makes them best-suited for the job. Try asking:

Are you trained in CPR? First aid?
Have you taken classes in child care? Would you be willing to take classes if necessary?
What is your education level?
Are you fluent in any other languages besides English?
Feel free to add nanny interview questions relevant to your children’s specific needs, such as secondary languages, medical conditions and so on. 

What health questions should I cover in the nanny interview?
Have you gotten the COVID vaccine? If not, are you planning on getting one?
Do you take the flu shot?
Are you up to date on other immunizations, including whooping cough? 
How can I ask a potential nanny about previous positions?
Now it’s time to discuss the candidate’s work history (you’ll also want to call professional references before making an offer). The families they worked for previously may be vastly different from your own, but try to get a feel for how their experience lines up with your needs by asking:  

What was your most recent position? If there was a gap, what did you do on your hiatus?
What was your typical daily routine with your last family?
What were some of the best things about your previous job? The worst?
Have you had negative work situations? If so, what have you learned from them?
How have you handled difficult situations, like a baby crying uncontrollably or a child talking back?
Have you ever had a child care emergency? What happened?
What is your experience with children who have/need/are [insert specific situation]?
What was your longest stay with a family? What was your experience with them?
Are you looking to stay long-term with a family or what is your time frame for your next position?
This is also where they may ask more questions about your family to see if you align with their needs. If they are serious about the position, expect to answer a lot of questions.

Questions to ask about schedules, personal preferences and more
Now that you’ve established that this nanny is a potential finalist for the job, you can get into the nitty gritty of the job description or your requirements. This could include discussing the hourly schedule, days off or benefits packages that weren’t discussed before.

You should also ask questions to see how well your position requirements mesh with their expectations. Ask questions like:

How flexible is your schedule? Would you be available if we occasionally need you to arrive early or stay late?
Are you willing to cook/do light housework/take care of pets/[insert other task]? Does your salary requirement increase if so?
Do you play sports, play musical instruments, have any specific hobbies, [insert other activity that is important to your family]?
Are there any activities or responsibilities that you can’t or won’t do?
Are you comfortable with the physical demands associated with the position?
You should also always be upfront about any unique requirements your family has, whether cultural, religious, dietary and so on. You can ask about their experience or ability to work with:

A strict diet (food allergies, vegetarian or kosher diets, etc.).
Your religious or cultural practices.
Children with disabilities.
Medication needs (insulin, Epi-Pens, inhalers or generic medications when a kid is sick).
Your family, school or professional situations (divorce, a recent move, crazy work schedules, a child who needs help in school, etc.).
As you discuss these topics, stay tuned into how they’re responding. If you feel they’re not willing to meet your job requirements, you can always politely end the interview.

What questions can I ask a nanny about their caregiving style?
If the candidate meets your job requirements, you can discuss the most important part: the kids. As many families choose to meet candidates without children for the first interview, this part of the interview can be dependent on that important introduction.

If you like their answers to these questions, it’s time to introduce them to the kids:

What do you like best about being a nanny?
What do you find most challenging?
What’s the hardest day you’ve ever had as a nanny and what did you do to handle it?
Do you prefer more or less structure in your day? What do you think works best for children?
What have you found worked the best when working with parents to help raise their child? How would you handle a medical/behavioral/educational/other situation with the children? How would you address the situation with me?
What is your view of disciplining a child? What should be the nanny’s role?
Did you love their answers? It may be time to bring in the kids (or schedule a time to introduce them).

What questions should I avoid during a nanny interview?
As with any formal employee hiring process, you have to follow legal guidelines about the questions you ask. Even though hiring a nanny is a highly personal decision, you cannot ask a candidate about their:

Age.
Race/ethnic background.
Religious views.
Sexual orientation.
Marital status/plans on becoming pregnant.
Disability.
Arrest record.
If these things come up in the course of the conversation, you can also not legally claim them as reasons for not hiring them.

Now that you know what interview questions to ask a potential nanny, it’s just a matter of time before you find the one that is best for you.

6 must-have criteria when hiring a nanny
When hiring a nanny for the first time, you probably know you need to agree on pay, coordinate schedule availability and make sure personalities gel. But there’s other important nanny criteria to consider, according to Marcia Hall, certified professional nanny, Academy for Coaching Parents International (ACPI) certified coach for families and former executive director of the International Association of Nannies in Milwaukee.

“For instance, if the parents want a nanny long term, selecting an individual who is in college might not be the right choice because that individual would be less likely to commit to them indefinitely,” Hall says. “If the parents’ goal is for the nanny to be able to keep after-school activities and supplies well organized, the parents will want to make it a priority to find a caregiver who has experience juggling a lot of activities.”

Dr. Lisa Lewis, a pediatrician in Fort Worth, Texas recommends listing your three must-haves, then listing out your would-like-to-haves. “The nanny who meets all three must-haves plus the most would-like-to-haves is the best candidate,” she says.

Before you write your nanny job description, check out some of the top qualities and characteristics of a good nanny, according to experts. While every family’s requirements will be different, here’s the crucial nanny criteria you don’t want to miss when hiring.

What to look for in a nanny
1. Interest in working with children
This may sound obvious, but a nanny should delight in being around children, above all else. “A genuine desire to invest in the life of children should be the first requirement parents have for a nanny,” says Hall.


Dr. Wendy Sue Swanson, a pediatrician, adjunct professor of Medicine at Stanford School of Medicine, and director of digital health at Stanford’s Sean Parker Center for Asthma and Allergy Research, says to trust your intuition on whether a candidate has this quality.

“If something feels awkward, dishonest, wrong or unsafe during your search or interviews, follow that feeling and walk away from that candidate,” she says. “Delaying a hire is always better than making the wrong hire.”

“If something feels awkward, dishonest, wrong or unsafe during your search or interviews, follow that feeling and walk away from that candidate.”

2. Safety certifications and child care training
“First and foremost, any nanny or babysitter should learn CPR certification through the American Heart Association,” says Lewis.

Other training and certifications to look for may include:

Water safety instruction.
Baby care, child nutrition and child development classes.
A driver’s license with a clean driving record.
First-aid certification.
Lewis says formal education and degrees don’t necessarily have to be must-haves. What’s most important is having good references and experience.

3. Special needs training
If you’re hiring a nanny to care for a child with special needs, whether those needs are from a disability, allergies or otherwise, it’s important that the nanny you hire is capable of handling that particular situation — though it’s not necessarily a requirement to have past experience with the same need or even special certifications.

“Parents should look for a quick learner and someone who is eager to learn about the need,” says Hall. “If the parent has an initial interview with an individual and by the second conversation, that person has already done some research into the special need, that show of initiative should be highly sought after.”

Lewis advises asking the child’s doctor how a caretaker would obtain some extra instruction for the needs at hand, since every child’s situation is different, and Hall suggests offering to pay for any extra courses or certifications.

4. Caregiving philosophies
A lot of parenting philosophies are floating around these days: attachment parenting, free-range parenting, authoritative parenting, slow parenting. If any of these are important to you, be sure your nanny is aware. Ask specific questions about your preferences, such as favorite type of carrier if you value baby-wearing, and you’ll get a good sense of their prior knowledge and current interest.

Also consider a candidate’s philosophy on screen time and even whether they’re keeping their own phone usage in check while caring for the children. “Unless specific monitored screen-time requirements are in place, it’s best to keep the household screen-free while the nanny is taking care of the children,” Lewis says.

If there are any philosophy clashes, it’s not necessarily a deal-breaker.

“The relationship between parent and nanny is really a partnership and just like all partnerships, each person has strengths and weaknesses, but all should be on the same page about the overall goals and rules of the house,” Hall says.

“The relationship between parent and nanny is really a partnership and just like all partnerships, each person has strengths and weaknesses, but all should be on the same page about the overall goals and rules of the house.”

— Marcia Hall, certified professional nanny
5. Ability to take on additional household responsibilities
While care of your children should be your nanny’s first priority, Hall says reasonable chores to ask a nanny to do include:

Doing the children’s laundry and linens.
Cleaning dishes the children and nanny use.
Basic cleanup and organizing of the children’s toys and rooms.
But if you want your nanny to take on additional household chores or duties, then you need to work with the nanny and negotiate additional pay for those.

“The employer can determine together with the nanny what responsibilities might be,” Hall says. “A detailed explanation of them, including extra compensation, should be included in a work agreement.”

6. Complementary personality traits
A personality match between nanny and employer is similar to dating and can make or break a working relationship. So how do you know from an interview whether opposites will attract or repel? You need to ask the hard questions, Lewis says, such as, “What will you do if my child cries?”

Other good questions to ask a prospective nanny:

Do you tend to keep a more structured or a more spontaneous schedule when you take care of a child?
What do you like least and most about caregiving and why?
What kind of play do you enjoy with children?
And then ask your children to talk with candidates. Even if the kids are shy, you’ll get an idea of how the nanny will interact with them. “Children are instinctual and will likely have a good or bad feeling about a candidate,” Swanson says.

Recognize, too, that a nanny’s personality can complement your own and benefit the children in a special way; it doesn’t necessarily have to be the same.

Keep in mind: Hiring a nanny gets easier with practice
Rest assured, even those who have hired multiple nannies have a hard time prioritizing their wish list. But Swanson promises that it gets easier.

“I’ve just completed another search for support from a nanny and this time, for my older children, it was smooth and the least stressful it’s been for me,” she says, noting that she was more confident in her priorities and sticking to them. “If this is your first search, it will undoubtedly cause a little queasiness. I think like all things, we get better at this the more we do it.”",https://www.care.com/c/6-criteria-to-evaluate-to-hire-nanny/

How do I screen a nanny? These are the essential safety checks
Trusting the care of your children to a stranger is never an easy move, but it’s a decision all parents face at one point or another. That’s why parents need to follow steps to make sure the people they trust their kids with are safe. While schools and daycare centers follow governmental regulations for background checks, the same is not always true for household staff. Vetting a nanny is one instance where parents need to do their own due diligence.

It may feel awkward asking about background checks and references, but it’s a standard question when screening a nanny, says Brooke Barry, owner of an emergency and drop-in child care business in the Pittsburgh area. “You are hiring, essentially, an extension of your family. This is a person who will not only physically care for your children, but will be pouring into them emotionally and socially as well.”

The process of screening a nanny has many steps, and they are all equally important. Here’s how to properly vet a nanny, according to industry pros.

Key takeaways
Hiring a nanny requires careful screening to ensure a child’s safety and well-being.
Experts recommend a thorough process that includes detailed interviews, reference checks, background screenings and a paid trial period.
Clear contracts and attention to red flags — such as refusal to undergo checks — help protect both families and caregivers while providing parents peace of mind.
How do I properly screen a nanny?
“Thoroughly vetting a nanny or childcare provider is a critical step in ensuring the safety and well-being of children,” says Muffetta Krueger, founder and CEO of Muffetta Household Staffing Agency. 

Through interview questions, reference checks, trial periods and background checks, parents have the best chance of finding the perfect fit for their needs. “This approach gives parents peace of mind, knowing their children are in capable and caring hands.”

1. Interview thoroughly
There’s no point in moving forward with checking references and background checks if you don’t click, so it’s important to thoroughly interview all nanny candidates. You can use our interview questions checklist to make sure you cover all the bases when meeting a potential caregiver. In addition to those, Krueger is always sure to ask candidates the following: 

How would you handle a medical emergency?
What activities would you plan for a child of this age?
Can you share an example of how you’ve managed a challenging behavior in the past?
These types of questions give parents a sense of an applicant’s personality as well as their ability to handle stressful situations. 

Don’t underestimate the “vibe check,” either. A candidate may be a great nanny, but not a great fit for a particular family. A child care provider with similar beliefs about discipline and child development is important, but so is one who loves hiking for nature-oriented families, for example.

“Speaking directly with past employers can provide valuable insights into the caregiver’s reliability, interpersonal skills and performance.”

— Muffetta Krueger, staffing agency founder and CEO
2. Check references
While it may feel a little awkward to call up strangers and ask about a potential nanny, checking references is an essential step that will also provide insight into a possible candidate. 

Krueger suggests contacting at least three references. “Speaking directly with past employers can provide valuable insights into the caregiver’s reliability, interpersonal skills and performance.” When calling references, ask questions such as: 

What were their job duties and responsibilities?
Why did they leave?
Were you satisfied with their job performance? Why or why not?
Were they always reachable while they were working for you?
Does this person work well independently?
Did this person show initiative?
What was the reason this person gave you for wanting to do this kind of work?
For a full rundown of what to ask, check out our guide to checking references.

3. Request a background check 
No matter how much you click with a potential nanny, get a background check. It provides not only crucial information but legal protections as well, according to attorney Benson Varghese. 

As founder and managing partner at Varghese Summersett, he regularly advises families on legal matters involving caregivers. “Parents should use criminal, sex offender and civil litigation databases beyond basic web resources,” he urges. “In my practice, parents have relied on inadequate or outdated checks and missed crucial red flags.” For example, one of his clients hired a caregiver who had theft offenses that were missed by a low-quality background check. 

There are many options for running background checks. Krueger’s agency uses Checkr, which can report on both state and federal crimes and infractions. Care.com requires all individual caregivers on our platform undergo a criminal screening. While a Care.com Background Check is a great place to start, it does not replace the safety precautions that families should take on their own.

While there are some variances by state, a criminal records check should typically include: 

Social Security Number (SSN) trace.
Multi-Jurisdictional database search.
Sex offender search.
Federal courthouse records search.
County criminal records search.
In addition to these checks, Krueger advises parents to check professional certifications. “Check the validity of certifications such as first aid, CPR and any specialized training in child care. These qualifications can be lifesaving in emergencies.”

4. Use a search engine
While it may seem basic, the internet is a powerful tool — and most of us leave a digital footprint on it. “A review of online profiles can reveal any concerning behavior,” says Krueger. A scan of public-facing content helps parents address any major red flags in behavior.

5. Schedule a nanny trial
Once the requisite interview, reference checks and background checks have been completed, Krueger suggests families set up a trial period for their nanny that is clearly outlined in a contract signed by all parties. The contract should detail the length of the trial period as well as terms for breaking the contract. 

During a trial period, nannies are paid and conduct the daily child care duties that will be required of them if hired permanently. Clearly outline expectations and communicate concerns — on both sides. A typical trial period ranges from one week to one month, but choose what works best for your family.

For more guidance, here are the details on how to conduct nanny trial.

“I’ve worked with families that avoided major issues by having binding agreements. These documents are essential for legal reference and protection.”

— Benson Varghese, attorney and managing partner
6. Use a nanny contract
A clearly written contract protects everyone involved, adds Varghese. “These contracts should include tasks, timetables, payment conditions and behavioral requirements, such as no drug or alcohol usage at work,” he tells parents. 

A contract that outlines expectations at the outset reduces the chase of issues down the line. “I’ve worked with families that avoided major issues by having binding agreements. These documents are essential for legal reference and protection.”

Here are some essentials to include when writing a nanny contract.

What red flags should I watch out for when screening a nanny?
While it is impossible to predict every situation that may occur, Varghese notes some specific red flags that should cause a family to pause. 

If a potential nanny offers to self-submit a background check, let them know you prefer to do your own. “About 40% of my daycare instances [of self-reported checks] included hiring deception,” he says. Doing your own background check can help prevent this.

A refusal to complete a background check or sign a contract is also a red flag that shouldn’t be ignored. Contracts and background checks are both standard and essential, says Krueger.

The final word on how to vet a nanny
While entrusting their children to a new acquaintance is always a big step for parents, following the proper steps to screen a nanny before hiring provides reassurance. Background checks, interviews, conversations with references and a trial period are all tools parents have in their toolbox to keep their kids safe and happy. 

Navigating the hoops of screening a new nanny may be time-consuming, but it is an investment that pays off. “This approach gives parents peace of mind, knowing their children are in capable and caring hands,” Krueger concludes.

The right questions to ask nanny references before you hire
So, you’ve found a nanny you’re really excited about. They have a great resume, they aced their interview and now it’s time for one of the final steps before you offer them the gig: reference checks.

Checking references may seem like a technicality when a candidate looks great on paper and is wonderful in person. But it’s important to do your due diligence, no matter how fantastic a potential nanny seems.

Sara Schaer, the co-founder and chief executive officer of Kango, a child-focused ride-sharing and babysitting app, says reference checks are one of the best ways to fill information gaps that might exist in a candidate’s performance history. They are also a good way to get a feel for how the caregiver really functions in a work environment.

Schaer, along with Kelly Price Noble, program chair of the College of Health Professions and School of Health Services Administration at the University of Phoenix, who has worked in healthcare for over a decade and mentors and manages caregivers of all kinds, share what you need to know and what questions to ask nanny references.

Key takeaways
Secure 2-3 recent references (non-family) who can speak to the nanny’s higher-level work performance and availability.
Crucially evaluate past performance by asking specific questions about communication, reliability, consistency, problem-solving, and their comfort level with driving children, if applicabl
Inquire about the nanny’s personality, their engagement with children and the child’s feedback to ensure a good fit beyond basic care duties and to understand their values.
Be aware of legally protected characteristics (age, religion, disability, etc.) and salary history that should be avoided during reference checks to ensure a fair hiring process.

What makes a good reference?
The nanny candidate should be able to provide more than one reference so you get a well-rounded view of their skills. “I’d say [candidates] need to provide at least two to three and have them not be immediate family members,” Schaer says. “You want it to be someone they’ve worked for in a higher capacity.”

“I’d say [candidates] need to provide at least two to three [references] and have them not be immediate family members.”

— Sara Schaer, co-founder of Kango
Good references should also be:

Fairly recent, with at least one having worked with the candidate within the past year, so their evaluation of the person’s performance is fresh in their minds.
Available to speak on the phone, so you have the ability to ask follow-up questions and get as much information as you need.
Questions to ask nanny references
Once you get a reference on the phone, there are some must-ask questions that will ensure you get every bit of information you need to make the right hiring decision.

Ask employment basics
First, verify that the information the employee gave you about their work history is accurate.

Ask questions like:

How long did this person work for you?
What were their job duties and responsibilities?
How old was the child or children they cared for?
Why did they leave?
Were you satisfied with their job performance? Why or why not?
Find a nanny

Evaluate past performance
Once you’ve verified their employment history, evaluate the specifics of their performance. There are three major areas you should always ask about to get a clear picture of how they behave on the job, recommends Schaer: communication, reliability and consistency. To find out how they measure up in those areas, try asking questions like:

Did you feel like you were always informed of what was going on while they were caring for kids?
Were they always reachable while they were working for you?
Were they punctual, and did that continue to be the case the entire time they worked for you?
Does this person work well independently?
Did this person show initiative?
What were some areas in which they could improve?
What was the reason this person gave you for wanting to do this kind of work?
Schaer and Price Noble both also recommend asking about a time when the employee dealt with a difficult situation or emergency at work — a tantrum, an injury, etc. — and how they handled it.

“Some of our very best providers actually had references describe what happened,” says Schaer. “[They’ll say:] ‘A child fell off the monkey bars and broke his arm, and I immediately was informed of what was going on.’ You [ask this because you] want to understand that this person is cool-headed, that they have expertise … that you know that they’re a competent adult caregiver that doesn’t just lose all ability to be in control of the situation.”

If you’ll need this person to drive your child, don’t forget to look into their driving record. Learn about background checks and more.

“It’s shocking how many times parents actually have no idea what someone’s driving record is and yet they might be asking a caregiver to drive their own — the parents’ — car and take kids from A to B,” says Schaer. Try asking a question like, ‘Did this person ever drive your child or loved one around? If they didn’t, would you have felt comfortable with him or her doing that?’ That will help you evaluate the employer’s level of trust in their former employee.

“It’s shocking how many times parents actually have no idea what someone’s driving record is and yet they might be asking a caregiver to drive their own — the parents’ — car and take kids from A to B.”

— Sara Schaer, co-founder of Kango
Learn more about personality and values
One thing many people forget to assess when checking references is “the fun stuff,” says Price Noble. Who are they outside of work, and how does their personality play into their role as a caregiver? Ask:

What was your child’s feedback about this person?
Tell me one of the great things they used to do with your kids?
Did you get the feeling that this person was enthusiastic and happy about doing this job?
What did this person do to keep the person or people in their care active? (Talk to them, read stories, play music, go for walks, etc.) This will help you get an idea of what the day-to-day activities might look like.
What was your favorite thing about working with this person?
Is there anything we should know as a future potential employer of this person, personality-, compensation- or behavior-wise?
Questions to avoid asking
By law, there are certain questions you cannot ask when checking a reference. These are in line with the same kinds of questions that cannot be asked during a job interview and include personal information that could be potentially discriminatory.

“Do not ask about their age,” says Price Noble. “Do not ask about their religion. Do not ask if they have disabilities.”

Equal opportunity employment laws also protect against discrimination based on race, sex, class and pregnancy status, so it’s best not to inquire about those things during the hiring process. Similarly, asking about a person’s salary history is illegal in many states, including California, Delaware, Oregon, Massachusetts, as well as in some cities, including New Orleans, New York City, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. Several more cities and states are considering bills to make questions about salary history illegal, too.

What to do if there’s a bad reference
Occasionally, you may get a “bad” reference. These are references who barely remember someone, have trouble recalling certain details or give an unexpectedly negative review of the person’s performance.

If the reference barely remembers any details, it’s possible the person worked for them too long ago or exaggerated their role. In these cases, you’ll want to request additional references, says Schaer. If someone can’t provide additional references, that may be a red flag that they’re fabricating their work history or don’t have more recent employers who are willing to refer them.

Similarly, references who only have negative things to say about an employee are a red flag. You can request more references to vet the negative things you heard, and/or move on to another candidate.

Should I run a background check before hiring a nanny?
If you were considering hiring an employee for your business, you’d run a background check on them, right? So why wouldn’t you do this for someone who will be working in your home or with your kids? Many people hire a nanny based on interviews and the good word of references, but these alone may not uncover past misdeeds that could cause concern.

“Hiring a caregiver is a big decision, and people want peace of mind,” says Tammy Tucker, of National Crime Search, Inc., a background screening business, which has experience screening nanny candidates. “Background checks can help parents ensure they’re hiring a trustworthy nanny to care for their children and to keep them safe.” Tucker adds that it’s not enough to simply Google a person’s name.

Key takeaways
Background checks provide crucial insights when you’re hiring a new nanny: They help uncover criminal history, driving records and other red flags that interviews and references may not reveal.
Not all background checks are equal: Instant online checks often miss key records while thorough screenings require checking county-level databases.
Costs vary based on depth: Basic background checks start around $60, but a comprehensive screening can cost up to $300.
Choose a reputable background check service: Look for accredited providers compliant with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and ensure candidates authorize the check.
Why should I run a background check before hiring a nanny?
Although background checks are not always 100% reliable or accurate, they can help you get a better sense of the risk an individual may pose and will give you an opportunity to discuss the circumstances surrounding any criminal records that may be uncovered, to help you make the best hiring decision for your unique care needs. Proper background checks can tell you a lot about a person, Tucker notes, including their criminal history and an idea of the person’s character.

“Gathering as much information as possible about a potential caregiver will help people make an educated and informed hiring decision,” she says.

Most background investigations raise no red flags, says Mike Coffey, president of background screening company Imperative in Fort Worth, Texas. Imperative owns PFC Information Services, which specializes in screening caregivers, and provides the Investigative Criminal Plus Check that is available for Premium Care.com members to purchase.

However, at least a fourth of PFC’s reports identify some sort of criminal record, he says. Some are minor items in the distant past, but “some are more significant and are things you would want to know before you invited someone into your home,” Coffey says.

To help maintain a safe community, Care.com requires all individual caregivers on our platform to undergo a criminal screening through our Care.com Background Check. A Care.com Background Check is a good place to start, but it does not replace the safety precautions that families should take on their own. Our membership eligibility standards for caregivers may differ from your hiring standards, and we don’t share Care.com Background Check reports for privacy reasons. We strongly recommend following our 3 safety steps for hiring in-home care, which includes running your own background check.

What issues will a nanny background check uncover?
Depending on the package, background checks can reveal criminal records, records of motor vehicle infractions, and potentially other things though the degree of thoroughness can vary by provider and level of scrutiny you desire. Tucker says a thorough background checking service looks for misdemeanors and felonies from the past seven to 10 years.

If the nanny will transport your child, she says it’s smart to run a Motor Vehicle Records Check to see if they have a valid driver license and any traffic violations in their state of licensure.

Coffey says television dramas give the impression that criminal records are all available in one database, when in fact, America has a decentralized criminal records system. He says there’s no reliable nationwide database, which means that relying on “instant” online background checking services will miss about half of the criminal records that a thorough investigation will find.

He explains that about 98% of criminal cases originate at the local county level, and those records usually aren’t online, so a good background check requires investigators to obtain records from individual courthouses. A quality background check can also look for indicators of behavior that haven’t yet risen to the level of a crime, Coffey says.

“For instance, we’ve seen nannies who are subject to restraining orders from previous employers or family members,” he says. “This can be a big red flag for a family considering inviting a nanny into their home to care for their child.”

He adds that minor theft offenses, especially recent ones, could also be a dealbreaker for someone you want to trust in your home.

To learn more about background checks, visit the Care.com Safety Center.

What does a nanny background check cost?
The price of a background check varies depending on how extensive of a screening you want. A basic check can start around $60, and increases based on how much information you request and how many places the candidate has lived. Coffey, whose Imperative company offers an Investigative Criminal Plus background check through the Care.com platform, says that a thorough background check typically costs about $300.”   

How do I choose a background check screening service?
Coffey recommends avoiding any service that claims to be instant. Tucker also recommends choosing a background service that’s accredited through the Professional Background Screening Association (PBSA). 

“All of those companies are compliant with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which sets the guidelines for conducting background checks,” she says. “A compliant company will also require the job candidate to complete an authorization form to run the background check and will have methods to verify any criminal records.”

Coffey encourages families to use an employment application process with direct questions about the nanny’s education, work experience and criminal history.

After the interview process, let the nanny know that you plan to run a routine background check on your final candidates — though some jurisdictions require employers to make a conditional offer before running a background check or asking any questions about prior criminal history, so make sure you know the laws in your state.

If your candidate would like to proceed, then you will need them to authorize the screening when requested. If they refuse to comply, that may be a red flag and a dealbreaker for your family.  The candidate has rights, too, so be sure if you make a decision based on the information in the background check that you provide all appropriate notices to the candidate. 

“If the parents will conduct a thorough application and interview process, then all the background investigation should be is a verification that the applicant told the truth,” Coffey says. “And if you catch them in even a small lie, do you really want to trust them with your child?”

Is a nanny trial the key to starting off on the best foot possible? Experts think so. Here's how to make the most of it.

Here’s why you need a nanny trial — plus 7 tips to make the most of it
Finding the right nanny is hard work, and it’s important to make sure the person you hire is going to be a great fit for your family. One smart way to do this? A nanny trial.

When Sara Cantwell, a San Francisco mom of twin boys, and her husband hired their first nanny, they let her go the very same week after the nanny was repeatedly tardy. That meant the family had to nearly go back to square one, which put them behind in their search and schedule. It was then that Cantwell, a product and marketing professional, decided that a nanny trial was necessary to ensure she hired competent, loving care that suited her family’s need and dynamic.

“A trial is good for both families and nannies. You’re interviewing and evaluating each other to see if it’s going to work.”

— Sara Cantwell, San Francisco parent
“A trial is good for both families and nannies,” she observes. “You’re interviewing and evaluating each other to see if it’s going to work.” Amy Osborn, founder of Genuine Nannies, agrees. “Trials can give the family a better idea of how the nanny might blend into their home life, how they interact with the children and the way their skills harmonize with the family’s needs,” she says.

But how should families and nannies structure a nanny trial that works for all parties? Here are seven key tips.

What is a nanny trial?
A nanny trial is a brief period during which a nanny works with a family so each party can see if it’s a good fit. “It’s an introduction to the household, routines, schedules and neighborhood, smoothing the transition process if and when the family decides to move forward with that person,” Osborn explains.

While it may not be on everyone’s radar, setting up a nanny trial period is common when searching for a nanny. Jennifer Talia, a placement counselor with Town and Country Resources, a company that Care.com owns, notes that of their clients “95% of families will set up a trial.”

7 expert tips for a successful nanny trial
1. Set up a 1-week trial period
After initial interviews, Talia advises moving forward with nanny candidates by setting up a one-week nanny trial period. “That’s typically enough time for both the nanny and the family to make a decision,” she says. Some families will do trials with multiple nannies, she notes, while others may set up a nanny trial with just one as a final step in the process.

If a full one-week trial can’t be worked into schedules, Talia recommends a short trial — or what she terms a working interview. This is when a nanny would interact with the child or children in the home and even potentially take them on activities, while the parent(s) observes. “A working interview, even if it’s a couple of days or just a few hours, can still help you both understand the chemistry and how personalities mesh,” she says.

Venture capitalist Neena Kadaba, parent to a 5-year-old boy and 2-year-old girl, did a trial run with her current nanny. “She came for a couple hours a day for four or five days,” Kadaba says. “I liked her and thought it would work out, but it was helpful to have her get to know the kids and their routine a bit before fully committing.”

2. Align on expectations and write them down
Families should think through what they expect from the nanny — and, conversely, nannies should be upfront about what they’re willing to do. “Have a conversation about what your needs are,” Talia says.

She offers families a work agreement template to help them identify the specifics, whether it’s light housekeeping, driving the children to school and team practices or speaking a second language with them. If all goes well, this work agreement could be used as part of a contract for full-time work moving forward. Regardless, it’s important to be clear on what’s required both during the trial as well as later on during full-time employment.

“You want to cover things like how they’re paid, what happens if you’re going out of town, time off, etc,” Kadaba says. “It really prevents issues later on.”

Cantwell even developed a handbook that covers everything from daily schedules and safety procedures to social media preferences related to the kids. “I give it to the nanny before the trial starts,” Cantwell says. “We also talk about it in person at the beginning.”

3. Remember that trials are paid
Families should generally pay a fair wage that matches what the nanny will actually make. “You should only trial a nanny who’s in the range of what you’re prepared to pay,” Talia says.

“Families should choose the hourly rate the nanny will actually be paid if she or he gets the job,” she continues. “In the Bay Area, where we’re located, we suggest families stick with $23 per hour during the trial.”

To determine an appropriate rate for your area, check out our Cost of Care calculator.

4. Set yourself up for success
A nanny trial run should closely mirror actual home life, Talia says, whether that’s picking a child up from school or playing at home for the day.

“Don’t have a working interview where there’s no direction — remember the nanny is brand-new to your household,” says Talia. “Think through what he or she needs to be successful, whether that’s logistical information like phone numbers, addresses, and dietary restrictions or simple instructions like which parks to visit.” 

“Don’t have a working interview where there’s no direction — remember the nanny is brand-new to your household.”

— Jennifer Talia, placement counselor, Town and Country Resources
5. Speak up
It’s important to open the lines of communication with nannies during trial periods to get a sense of their approach with the children and receptivity to areas of responsibility.

Try to draw out information with specific questions around the things that are most important to you. For example: Was the light housekeeping easy to handle or too much? How was trying to get the baby down for her nap? How did the toddler react when you corrected his behavior?

This helps give a better sense of how things are going — and how the nanny might handle daily job demands.

Talia recommends setting aside 10 to 20 minutes to talk when the children are not there or are otherwise preoccupied. “This is your first opportunity to set the tone and practice open communication,” she says. “Both families and nannies should be open about their impressions.”

6. Make yourself available at home
If parents can make it work, it’s good to be home for a nanny trial, at least in the very beginning, Talia says. “I do advise families to be there at first until they feel comfortable,” she says. “After that, it’s good to leave for a bit and then evaluate how things feel when you come back. How are the kids? How’s the atmosphere in the house? Check your gut and see what it tells you.”

Osborn encourages ensuring children get a chance to connect one-on-one with a prospective caregiver. “Even if you’re sticking around, find something to do — answer some email, prep dinner, fold laundry,” she suggests. “Just give them some space to feel each other out.”

“After a trial run, I’ve never regretted the decision to let someone go — or hire them.”

— Sara Cantwell
7. Be honest about your feelings
If a family or a nanny doesn’t feel like it’s a good fit, it’s not a problem, Talia says. “That’s exactly why we do working interviews. Just be honest, direct and kind when you share it won’t work out,” she says.

Says Cantwell: “After a trial run, I’ve never regretted the decision to let someone go — or hire them.”

How do I hire a nanny from start to finish?
Let’s face it — hiring a nanny can seem daunting, especially when you don’t know where to begin. But if you break the process down step by step, you’re more likely to do a thorough job and will have a great nanny hiring experience.

To help you keep track, you can use our handy “How to Hire a Nanny” checklist at the bottom of this page.

Key takeaways
Hiring a nanny can feel overwhelming, but breaking it down into clear steps — like defining your needs, setting a budget and conducting interviews — makes the process more manageable and effective.
Key parts of the process include checking references, running a background check, setting up proper taxes and drafting a thorough nanny contract.
Using resources like checklists, calculators and sample contracts can help ensure a smooth hiring experience and a successful long-term arrangement.
1. Decide what type of nanny you need
Do you need a live-out nanny or a live-in nanny? Is a night nanny, a part-time nanny or after-school nanny the right choice for you? Before you get into the hiring process, decide what type of nanny will best suit your family.

Write a freewheeling list of all the criteria you want your nanny to meet: a sense of fun, early childhood education credits, a perfect driving record, first-aid training, etc. Make a list of deal breakers: smokers, speeding tickets, etc. This will help you craft a precise job description that will attract nannies with the qualities you want most.

2. Calculate your budget
What can you afford to pay your new nanny? Don’t forget to factor in things like expenses for activities, annual raises and bonuses. And make sure you include taxes as well.


We recommend a three-step process:

First, familiarize yourself with all the factors that affect a nanny’s rate.
Second, use our Cost of Care Calculator to learn what the going rate is for nannies in your area.
Then use our nanny tax calculator to see how much to set aside for taxes.
3. Post a nanny job
When you’re ready with your super-detailed and upbeat nanny job description, post it on a job site, like Care.com.

4. Interview nanny candidates
When applicants begin to answer your ad, consider each one with an eye toward professionalism and experience. Do their qualifications match your needs? How well do they convey why they want this job? Start to screen your candidates and narrow your choices. For definite mismatches, send an immediate “no, thank you” note as a courtesy.

Pick the best five to ten candidates and arrange a phone interview or meeting at a neutral location, like a coffee shop. Ask them questions and see what kind of rapport you have with each candidate.

When you have cut the list down to your top three candidates, invite them to your home for an in-person interview. Discuss how your household runs and ask detailed questions about their background and child care philosophies. You may even want to pay them to do a nanny trial one morning or afternoon. That way you can see how they interact with your kids. Try not to watch like a hawk (tough as that may be), so you get a real sense of how they will naturally interact.

5. Check nanny references
Don’t forget to check references. Did other families have good experiences with this nanny? Are there any red flags to watch out for? You also want to make sure you’re not talking to a candidate’s relative or friend — who may be giving you the wrong impression. Take a look at these questions to ask references before making your calls.

6. Make the offer
You often just know when you have the right candidate. Trust your instincts if you really connect with one nanny over another. Just make sure you let the other applicants know the position has been filled. You can certainly propose a longer trial period of a week or two in case the situation just doesn’t pan out. Just work that into your nanny contract (more on that in a minute).

7. Get a background check
Have you found a nanny you really like and you know they would be a perfect fit? Great! But don’t forget to obtain a background check to make sure everything is OK.

Using Care.com to find your nanny? To help maintain a safe community, every individual caregiver on our platform starts with a required background check. While our Care.com Background Check is a good place to start, it does not replace the safety precautions that families should take on their own. Our membership eligibility standards for caregivers may differ from your hiring standards, and we don’t share Care.com Background Check reports for privacy reasons. We strongly recommend following our 3 safety steps for hiring in-home care, which includes running your own background check.

To learn more about background checks and safety, visit the Care.com Safety Center.
8. Set up taxes
Now that you’re a household employer, you’re responsible for paying employer taxes. Familiarize yourself with the steps to setting up nanny taxes and payroll and why it’s important to hire your nanny as an employee not as an independent contractor. You can even use our nanny tax calculator to help you estimate how much you can expect to pay in employment taxes, as well as calculate any possible tax breaks you may be eligible for!

Determine if you want to organize the taxes on your own or use a comprehensive tax and payroll service, such as Care.com HomePay.

File notice with your state that you’ve hired an employee and have your nanny fill out a W-4 form for tax withholding.

And while you’re at it, set up your own Federal Employer Identification Number if you don’t already have one. See our nanny tax requirements by state to understand everything that is involved with being a household employer.

9. Check your insurance coverage
You should also understand what kind of insurance coverage is adequate for your new employee. Consult with your insurance broker to make sure you have enough umbrella insurance now that you have someone working for you in your home.

10. Write a nanny contract
Everyone who hires a nanny should have a nanny contract. The contract protects your family and the nanny as well. This is the place to spell out everything: salary, employment benefits, job requirements, hours, expectations, etc. The more detailed your contract, the better (get started with our sample nanny contract). Discuss it with your nanny and let them weigh in.

Now that you’ve hired a nanny, follow this checklist for their first day of work to make sure you have everything you need. Talk to your nanny about safety and any issues that may crop up. And prepare your kids for the nanny to help the process go smoothly.

Nanny contracts: Everything parents need to put in writing
So, you’ve interviewed a slew of candidates and have finally found the perfect nanny. Now what? Before jumping in and having your nanny start caring for your kids, it’s important to make sure you’re clearly aligned on expectations surrounding this job. Formal contractual agreements, or nanny contracts, can help with that and, ultimately, protect your family and the caregiver.

“Having a contract avoids any kinds of miscommunication, and it avoids any of those grey areas,” says Lindsay Thomason, founder and owner of Los Angeles nanny agency the Nanny League. “The family wants to make sure the nanny is treating this job like a professional career just as they would at a desk job in corporate America. By having a contract, they’re saying what they agreed upon, and having it in writing helps solidify it.”

“Having a contract avoids any kinds of miscommunication, and it avoids any of those grey areas.”

— Lindsay Thomason, owner, The Nanny League
Indeed, a nanny contract is an indispensable tool to ensure everyone is on the same page and remains that way for the duration of employment. Here’s why you should consider drafting a nanny contract, what you should include in it and how to make it happen.

Why nanny contracts are a must
Sure, a nanny contracts may feel weighty and formal, and the idea of having to work through the details of one with someone you don’t know very well yet can seem awkward. But putting a contract in place upfront will ensure that you are on the same page about important topics (it’s much worse to tackle them when problems arise) and will end up protecting both you as the employer and the nanny as your employee. In fact, many nanny agencies require the use of a contract.


“A contract protects a family during the term of the employment because it allows them to hold the nanny accountable for what the job description and job duties are going to entail,” says Meghan Alexander, a lawyer at Alexander Law Firm in Austin, Texas, who has created nanny contracts for many families.

“A contract protects a family during the term of the employment because it allows them to hold the nanny accountable for what the job description and job duties are going to entail.”

— Meghan Alexander, lawyer
Nanny contracts remain in place throughout the nanny’s time with your family, which means it will set clear expectations at the start and can also help if the nanny isn’t holding up their end. For example, if the nanny is supposed to take the kids to gymnastics on Tuesdays but fails to, or if they were supposed to go on the family vacation and refuses to go, the nanny contract gives the family an easy way to address the issue and point out that she is breaking the agreement, says Alexander.

“It gives them a basis for getting their employee to do their job and evaluating them,” Alexander says. “If they are supposed to do something in the contract but have not done it, it gives them a forum to have the discussions. And if it’s just not working out, and the nanny is not meeting the expectations that are set out in the contract, then it’s much easier for them to let them go than a subjective, ‘Well, it’s not working out.’”

Having all the rules, expectations and terms of employment in a contract helps both sides if there is ever a dispute.

“If there’s ever any claim for pay or benefits or vacation or hours, that stuff is in writing, so that protects everybody,” Alexander says.

Find sample nanny contracts online or meet with a lawyer
One way to quickly get a nanny contract is to download a free sample contract from Care.com HomePay. There are also various pre-made nanny contracts online, most of which require a fee to download. A popular one is the A to Z Nanny Contract, which costs $45.

If you want a contract completely customized for your family, you can create your own; you just need to have you and your nanny sign and date it. However, if you don’t have a legal background, you may want to pay to have a lawyer review it to ensure you’re not leaving out anything important. Another option is to pay a local civil and/or contracts lawyer to draw up a tailor-made contract for you. Some lawyers charge flat fees for creating these types of contracts, while others charge by the hour, and the cost ranges depending on the lawyer’s level of experience.

What to include in nanny contracts
Here are some of the key items that should be included in your nanny contract:

1. Job duties: child care, household work and pet care
Sure, you want your nanny to take care of your child, but will their duties extend to some household work, too? Be sure to outline the roles and responsibilities expected of your nanny, and be very specific. Specify whether the nanny’s duties include things like cooking, cleaning or care of pets.

“A family may think, ‘Well, of course, they’re going to cook dinner every night.’ And a nanny may think, ‘I would never cook dinner. I’m not a cook. I’m a nanny,’” Alexander explains. “But if there’s not a discussion about it and it’s not in writing, then that can be difficult.”

“A family may think, ‘Well, of course, they’re going to cook dinner every night.’ And a nanny may think, ‘I would never cook dinner. I’m not a cook. I’m a nanny,’”

— Meghan Alexander, lawyer
Pro tip: Avoid vague terms like “light housekeeping” and instead itemize duties so that it is very clear.

2. Hours and pay: overtime, taxes and schedule of payment
Your contract should outline the schedule the nanny is being asked to work and how much they will be compensated. It should clearly state the hourly rate and what the gross salary comes to, Thomason says, along with overtime rates.

“It really helps to go over the hours expected. If they’re working over 40 or 45 hours in a week, are they getting paid time and a half?” Thomason says.

If you’re not sure what’s reasonable for pay, Care.com’s 2025 Cost of Care Survey found that the national average for weekly pay for a nanny caring for one child is $827.

The contract should also state when and how the nanny will be paid, and who is responsible for withholding taxes. If you plan to give your nanny any bonuses or raises, this should also be covered in the contract, Thomason says, and it should be clear if they will be automatic or dependent on job performance.

Also, check out our Cost of Care Calculator to get an idea of the going rate in your area.

3. Time off: vacation, sick days and backup care
Your nanny contract should clearly state which holidays the nanny gets off and if the nanny will receive any paid time off. Thomason says two weeks of paid vacation per year is typical, though it’s important to indicate if the dates are up to the nanny or the family. She says, in some cases, the timing of one of the weeks is the family’s choice, and the other week is the nanny’s choice. This is so the family can take a vacation the same time as their nanny to reduce the amount of time they have to find an alternative caregiver.

The contract should also clearly state if your nanny is expected or allowed to go on family vacations with you, and if so, what the pay rate is during that time.

Lastly, your contract should cover how much paid sick time your nanny will get. Thomason says five paid sick days is common for full-time nannies, but it can vary depending on your state’s laws and your preferences. It’s often wise to include details on what should happen if the nanny is too sick to come in for work but has used up all of their paid sick days — and any emergency backup care that might be available. For instance, you may want your nanny to be responsible for supplying a backup caregiver if they are unable to make it to work.

4. Transportation details
Transportation is an important safety issue that should be covered in your contract, Alexander says. She explains that it should outline if the nanny is allowed to transport your child regularly, and if not, if they are permitted to transport your child in an emergency. If driving is permitted, it should also say if the nanny will use her own car or your family car, and if there is a child safety seat provided and installed by your family. It can also include whether the nanny will be reimbursed for gas and/or mileage.

5. Performance reviews
Some nannies and families like to set official milestones for reviews. This could be to simply check in and see how things are going or to determine if the nanny is eligible for a raise. Some nannies like to sit down once a month for a review while others may want an initial 30-day check-in and then an official review after six months. Talk to your nanny and find out what feels best for them and your family.

6. Termination
It’s wise to list your official grounds for termination in the contract, so you and the nanny are aware of what constitutes grounds for dismissal. This could include theft, substance abuse or continuously showing up late. Keep in mind that employment laws vary by state, so consult with a local attorney to see if there are any employee rights of which you should be aware.

Your contract should also include how much notice is required if either you or the nanny decide it’s time to part ways. It’s common to have two to four weeks’ notice so you have time to find a new nanny or other child care arrangements, and the nanny has time to find a new job. If you’re letting go of the nanny for reasons unrelated to their performance, it’s common to offer two weeks of severance. But if you’re firing them for a misstep, it’s more common to give severance of just a week, or no severance at all.

7. Amendment process
As your kids grow and their needs change, it’s likely you’ll want to add to or adjust the contract, Alexander says.

“You’ll want some provision in the contract that says that the policies about the child’s day-to-day care will be amended as necessary,” she adds.

8. General house rules and guidelines
Thomason says there are several important items to get clear on that are very relevant to nannying but aren’t applicable to an employment contract in corporate America. For example, she says, is the nanny expected to swim? Are they required to not wear perfume? Do you require them to have CPR certification and flu shots? Do they need to keep the child on a special diet?

Alexander adds that you may want to also include information about whether it’s appropriate for the children to be disciplined, and if so, what that may entail.

How detailed you get about child care in the contract is totally up to you as the employer, says Alexander. She says she has seen some parents get so specific that they say how frequently the children should eat and when their diapers should be changed while others don’t include much detail at all. It really depends on how experienced the nanny is, how experienced your family is with nannies and what feels right to both of you.

“You can always add things in writing that maybe aren’t as formal, like information on medications they take or that they must be taken to gymnastics on certain days, just to give the nanny some direction, and again, just to put things in writing so everybody is on the same page and has the same understanding about what’s going to happen,” Alexander says.

You may also want to include details about whether your nanny is allowed to post pictures of your child on social media and if you will be using a nanny cam to monitor them.

While you may feel reluctant to ask your new nanny to use a written contract, keep in mind that it can help you and your employee start off on the same page and feel protected if anything goes amiss later.

“If the nanny previously agreed to something but is now refusing, you could look back at the document, and it would be grounds for discussion,” Thomason says. “It all comes down to expectations, and if the nanny is not abiding by what’s in that agreement, it gives the family grounds for finding a new nanny.”

11 employment benefits to consider offering your nanny
When hiring a nanny, some families put all the focus on hours and base pay and overlook the equally important aspect of providing their nanny with employment benefits.

Like other professionals, most nannies expect — and should get — job benefits that guarantee them paid time off, mileage reimbursement and other perks that make their jobs more secure and worthwhile. Think of it this way: Nannies have one of the most important jobs out there in raising your children and the next generation. Why shouldn’t they receive the same benefits other professionals get?

Still, according to the most recent INA Salary and Benefits Survey, 78% of nannies work as full-time professionals in their field — and many of them have training and education in child care-related subjects — but only 74% of nannies reported receiving basic benefits like paid time off.

“To be honest, I think a lot of parents miss these basic things,” says Katie Provinziano, managing director of Westside Nannies in Beverly Hills, California. “If they’re working with a nanny agency, we’re going to educate them, but [for] families hiring on their own, I don’t think that a lot of them think about the fact that they should offer benefits.”

While an extensive nanny benefits package is not a requirement for hiring, it’s important to remember that the nanny industry is highly competitive and ensuring the best quality child care means being willing to provide standard employment benefits commensurate with a nanny’s skill level and experience. Here are 11 nanny benefits you should consider offering.

Basic nanny benefits
These benefits should always be considered when hiring a full-time nanny.

1. Guaranteed pay and overtime
“If you’re hiring a nanny, they’re signing up for a certain amount of hours based on the amount of hours you need as a family,” says Provinziano. “They have bills, and those bills don’t change whether or not you get home early one night.”

According to the INA Salary and Benefits Survey, 76% of nannies receive “guaranteed pay” when the family does not need them. As such, Provinziano recommends guaranteeing a certain number of hours per week in your initial offer, as well as being prepared to offer overtime pay if a nanny is required to work more than 40 hours per week.

2. Sick days
Sick days are a must for any employee — especially for nannies because they work closely with children. There are currently no federal laws mandating sick leave. However, Provinziano notes that many states and cities have their own laws regarding the number of days that must be offered.

For example, employers in California are required to provide at least 24 hours — or three working days — of paid sick leave per year. But the city of Los Angeles requires employers offer at least 48 hours of paid sick leave per year, plus one additional hour accrued for every 30 hours worked, with an optional cap at 72 hours. It’s important to check with your local labor department to see what requirements there may be in your area.

If you plan on offering paid sick days, it’s also a good idea to have a backup child care plan in place.

“I always say you need a backup to the backup,” says Florence Ann Romano, former nanny of 15 years, author and child care advocate.

Day care is not always a viable option because slots fill up, and part-time care in a center can often be just as expensive as a full-time care. Instead, Romano recommends finding a local in-home child care provider who’s willing to work with you on an “a la carte” basis on the days your nanny can’t be in.

3. Paid time off
It’s common for employers to provide a minimum of one week of paid vacation per year, though many provide two, says Tonya Sakowicz, founder of Newborn Care Solutions.

Bryce Gruber, a New York City journalist and mom, says she offers her nannies two non-consecutive paid weeks off. “I’ve noticed from years of parenting and having the amazing help of nannies that it usually works out to Christmas week and a week during the summer,” Gruber says.

4. Paid holidays
It’s important to note that paid time off does not include holidays. Paid holidays are a separate benefit, and it’s typical for families to offer either all federal holidays or five to seven holidays of their choosing, according to Provinziano.

“Paid holidays would be if the holiday falls on [a nanny’s] regular workday, then she receives it off, paid,” she says. “If a nanny is required to work on a holiday, I would encourage families to give her time and a half.”

Reimbursements and stipends
Families may want to consider including the following reimbursements in their nanny contract.

5. Health insurance reimbursement
Health insurance is fast becoming a standard benefit for nannies, either by employers purchasing health insurance plans for their nannies or by reimbursing them for the partial cost of a plan. Employers can use the federal exchange to find a health plan if they wish to cover the full cost of health insurance.

The other option is to reimburse a nanny for the cost of their premiums. However, nannies must obtain health insurance through a private exchange or directly from an insurance company if they wish to be reimbursed. Per the Affordable Care Act, employers cannot reimburse employees for the cost of premiums on insurance plans obtained through the federal exchange without being subject to additional taxes and fees.

In cases where reimbursement is the best option, employers may want to take advantage of the Qualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangement (QSEHRA), which was signed into law by President Barack Obama in December 2016 as part of the 21st Century Cures Act. The QSEHRA allows an employer to reimburse an employee up to $5,850 for a single health plan or $11,800 for a family health plan per year tax free. Employees must provide proof of their healthcare costs, and then employers offer a monthly allowance to cover the costs, which is reported on the employee’s W-2. With the QSEHRA, all reimbursements are free of payroll tax for both the business and its employees.

6. Cell phone reimbursement
Some employers provide cell phone reimbursements for nannies if the nanny is frequently required to use her personal phone on the job. One example is if a nanny travels with the family and must use her phone to communicate with parents, or if a nanny is required to give frequent updates to parents or coordinate playdates and other activities.

“I would see what the nanny’s cell phone plan is, how much she’s using her phone for a work-related purpose and decide on what the appropriate amount is,” says Provinziano.

A few states — California, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, North & South Dakota, New York, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia — require cell phone reimbursements, though it varies how reimbursements must be given. Additionally, it may be helpful to check with your cell phone provider about adding another line for the nanny. Many family phone plans will allow you to add an extra line at a very low or no additional cost.

7. Mileage reimbursement
Whenever a nanny uses their personal car for on-the-job transportation, they need to be reimbursed.

“So for example, driving the kids to and from school, going grocery shopping, running errands and even driving the kids to and from a playdate,” says Provinziano. “Keep track of her mileage, and she should be reimbursed with the IRS standard mileage rate, which changes each year.”

Currently, the rate set forth by the IRS is 62.5 cents for every mile of business travel driven. Employees do have the option of calculating the actual costs of using their vehicle rather than using the standard mileage rates. However, per the IRS, employers cannot claim deductions for paying both mileage and depreciation. It must be one or the other.

Discretionary nanny benefits
Consider offering these extra nanny benefits.

8. CPR certification
“We encourage families to pay for their nanny’s CPR certification every two years,” says Provinziano.

It’s not a must, but it’s worth the investment for the safety of your children.

9. Continuing education
Occasionally families will offer to cover the costs of continuing education, such as child care or child development courses. While not a requirement, it can show that you’re invested in your nanny’s development as a professional — and your kids reap the benefits.

10. Annual bonuses
A bonus is a lovely way of showing appreciation for a nanny’s hard work and dedication, and it doesn’t have to be exorbitant. According to Romano, many nannies appreciate simply having an extra week’s pay presented as an annual bonus at the end of each employment year or around the holidays. Some employers, however, opt to pay a bonus of two week’s pay. 

11. Extra perks
When it comes to benefits, think outside the box. Consider adding a nanny to your existing gym membership or offering them one Friday off per month, if you’re able. Not only will perks like these help attract the best nanny, but they’ll help retain them, too.

“Look at what you as a family have that the nanny might value,” says Sakowicz. “Use of your box suite at an arena for any events you cannot attend? A ski condo that is free for a long weekend along with a ski pass and dinner gift certificate? Consider using that to honor your nanny’s dedication and hard work. Just be sure and consult with your tax professional to ensure you are complying with any necessary reporting for tax purposes.”

Most importantly, regardless of the benefits you decide to offer, make sure each is clearly outlined in your initial agreement with your nanny and don’t add any surprise duties or changes in benefits down the road.

“First and foremost, a nanny wants to know that she feels comfortable with the family she’ll be working with and that there are reasonable expectations of her,” says Susan Yara, a California working mom who has employed a full-time nanny.

Remember: Nannies have lives, too, Yara says. “Some have children [or] additional part-time work,” she says. “They want to know they can still make it for important events, can take time out for a doctor’s appointment or go on vacation, just like you would want.”",https://www.care.com/c/11-nanny-job-benefits/

Do nannies get paid vacation days? Yes, here’s how to handle PTO, sick days and more
When you hire a nanny, you’ll probably talk about things like pay rates and schedules. But do nannies get paid vacation, sick days and holidays? Being a nanny is a job, and just like any other profession, nannies should receive benefits like overtime, insurance and paid time off.

Lots of families forget to negotiate these things when they hire a caregiver so it’s important to talk about them before you officially hire someone. Just make sure you’ve reviewed the laws in your state or city because providing paid time off could be required even though there is no federal law mandating it. Once you’re in agreement, make sure you add all the details to your nanny contract.

Key takeaways
Nannies should receive benefits such as paid vacation, sick days, holidays, and overtime since being a nanny is a professional job. Discussing and including these details in a written contract helps avoid misunderstandings and ensures compliance with local laws.
Most families provide two weeks of paid vacation and coordinate it with their own family schedules to make planning easier. Setting clear rules about how and when vacation days can be used keeps communication smooth.
Offering paid sick days and holidays shows appreciation for your nanny and aligns with common employment practices. These benefits help maintain a strong, respectful, and lasting working relationship.
Do nannies get paid vacation?
Yes. Everyone needs some time off to recharge. And nannies definitely need some rest and relaxation after caring for your children. Two weeks of paid vacation time is typical — and we suggest the same for your nanny.

Many families try to coordinate their nanny’s vacation time around family vacations so they’re not left scrambling to find backup child care. Maybe your nanny takes one week off during the summer, while your family is visiting Disney World and then has one week to use whenever she want.

Set rules for using these vacation days. For example, how much notice does your nanny need to give you if they want to plan a vacation? How will they let you know: in-person, text or email? Can they split the days up or do they have to use it a week at a time?

Providing paid time off is crucial to attracting a good nanny and showing them you appreciate everything they do for your family. As long as you and your nanny communicate effectively and keep track of the time off that is used and available, it shouldn’t be a point of friction in your working relationship.

Do nannies get sick days?
Yes, they should. When your nanny is around kids all day, it’s inevitable that they’ll get sick. According to the most recent INA Salary and Benefits Survey, 80% of employers include paid sick and personal days in their nanny benefits. It’s most common for families to provide four or five days, but you should agree on an amount that is best for everyone.

Plan for your nanny’s sick day now by weighing your options for backup care.

How should I handle nanny paid holidays?
Holidays tend to be busy for everyone, so it’s natural to give your child care provider — especially those with kids and families of their own — some paid holiday time off. Eighty-two percent of employers provide paid holidays to their caregivers, according the INA. To make sure there is equal opportunity for all, these days should be negotiated based on what works for you and your nanny.",https://www.care.com/c/handling-nanny-vacations-holidays-and-sick-days/

How do you pay a nanny legally? All the info, from taxes to payroll
Congrats! You’ve found a nanny you’d like to hire. Now what? Once your nanny accepts your job offer, your responsibilities as an employer begin. That means putting the terms of your working relationship into a nanny contract, deciding on benefits and setting up payroll. It also means complying to state and federal regulations, including what many people call “nanny taxes.”

Nanny taxes refer to the federal and state payroll and tax responsibilities families have to manage when they hire a nanny to work in their home. While complying to these state and federal laws means you won’t be at risk of being slapped tax evasion fines, there are benefits for the caregivers, too. Nannies become eligible for state unemployment benefits, and a traceable payment history enables them do things like apply for credit cards, rent an apartment or lease a car. “We actually have nannies approaching us to work for us because we pay legally,” says Paul Cuthbert, of Newport, Michigan, who has hired several nannies. “It costs a little bit more than not paying legally, but it is so worth it.”

Follow this simple compliance checklist, and you can meet the requirements laid out in the IRS Publication 926 and your state.

Key takeaways
Nannies should be classified as household employees and obtain federal and state employer tax IDs.
Nanny employers need to file a New Hire report with their state, in addition to withholding income taxes, Social Security and Medicare taxes from their nanny’s paycheck.
You can make quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS to help manage your federal household employment taxes. A qualified tax preparer or financial expert can help you figure out how much to withhold, how much you owe and how to complete the necessary paperwork.

Checklist: How to pay a nanny legally
1. Your nanny should be classified as a household employee
The IRS has ruled that, with very few exceptions, nannies are employees of the families for whom they work — not independent contractors. This is regardless of the amount of hours worked, wages paid or what’s written in an employment contract. This means your nanny should be given a W-2 form, rather than a 1099 form, to file their taxes. Worker misclassification is considered a form of tax evasion and is a risk you should not be willing to take.

2. Obtain federal and state employer tax IDs
In order to file returns with the IRS and the state, you’ll need to obtain a federal employer identification number (EIN), as well as state tax ID(s) for unemployment insurance and, if applicable, state income taxes. These tax IDs identify you as a household employer, and you should apply for them through the IRS as soon as your nanny accepts your job offer.

3. File a New Hire Report with the state
All employers are required to file a New Hire Report with their state immediately after each new hire. Find the agency that oversees new hire reporting in your state.


4. Withhold federal and possibly state income taxes from your nanny’s pay each pay period
“Income taxes don’t technically have to be withheld from a household employee, but families should do it anyway so their caregiver doesn’t have to budget for the taxes on their own,” says Tom Breedlove, senior director of Care.com HomePay. “If the family doesn’t withhold and the caregiver waits until tax season to address this, they can be subject to underpayment penalties.”

You’ll know how much in income taxes to withhold from your nanny based on how they fill out their W-4 and state withholding form (assuming you live in a state that has income taxes).

5. Withhold Social Security and Medicare taxes from your nanny’s pay each pay period
These taxes are collectively known as FICA and must be withheld from your nanny’s pay. Social Security taxes will be 6.2% of your nanny’s gross (before taxes) wages and Medicare taxes will be 1.45% of their gross wages. Use this nanny tax and payroll calculator to see how much you should be withholding.

6. Pay state taxes and file state household employment tax returns on a regular basis
As a household employer, you are required to file state unemployment tax returns, typically on a quarterly basis, and remit (pay) unemployment insurance taxes. If you live in a state with income taxes, you’ll also need to file state income tax returns and send in the income taxes you’ve withheld from your nanny.

Note: Some states have different filing frequencies and could require monthly or annual deposits. Check the requirements in your state.


7. Make estimated tax payments to the IRS four times a year
To manage your federal household employment taxes, the IRS recommends you make estimated tax payments throughout the year to avoid underpayment penalties. You’ll send in the FICA taxes and federal income taxes withheld from your nanny along with the FICA taxes and federal unemployment insurance taxes you owe as a household employer during the following time periods:

January – March (paid in April)
April and May (paid in June)
June – August (paid in September)
September – December (paid in January of the next year)
8. Prepare year-end tax forms 
Once the calendar year ends, you’ll need to provide your nanny with their W-2 and file Form W-2 Copy A & Form W-3 with the Social Security Administration by the end of January. These forms summarize the wages you paid to your nanny, as well as the taxes that were withheld from them throughout the year. Since you’ve been keeping track of your nanny’s pay all year long, these forms should be relatively simple to complete. Additionally, you’ll file a Schedule H with your personal income tax return by the April 15 deadline.

Use this checklist during the year so you can avoid expensive, time-consuming mistakes. If you don’t want to manage this paperwork yourself, you can hire an accountant or use a nanny payroll service. While it may seem like a lot of work, when you handle all of your household employment responsibilities correctly, there are benefits: You become eligible for tax breaks that can help offset some of tax payments you’ve made during the year. In addition, your nanny will be entitled to the benefits that come with being paid on the books, such as Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance — benefits that all workers need and deserve.",https://www.care.com/c/setting-up-nanny-taxes-payroll/

What household information should I give my nanny on their first day?
Once you’ve found the perfect nanny for your family, you know it. It’s an exciting time, and sometimes important tasks can get lost in the mix. It’s easy enough to remember background checks and pay negotiations, but have you explained all aspects of the nanny’s schedule and any specific rules, like screen time guidelines, or given them instructions for how everything works — like your complicated old dishwasher? You can’t be over-prepared when it comes to the care of your children.

Use this checklist to make sure you and your nanny are on the same page before they get started and over the first few days of work. They’ll thank you for all the specifics when something unexpected pops up. Print out this page and check items off as you complete them to ensure peace of mind and a successful start to this journey with your new nanny.

Key takeaways
Finding the perfect nanny is an exciting milestone, but it’s crucial to ensure clear communication about household rules, safety procedures, schedules and expectations from the start.
This comprehensive checklist helps families cover everything from contact info and pet care to driving protocols and screen time rules, creating a smooth transition for everyone.
Sharing all the necessary details and keeping communication open sets the stage for a successful, stress-free relationship with your new caregiver.
Contact and personal information
Exchange contact information. This includes home address, phone numbers (work and cell) and email for your nanny and for all members of your family. Determine the best way to reach each other during the day or in case of an emergency. For your paperwork, you may need their license number and taxpayer ID number.
Make important numbers easy to access. Write down numbers for the pediatrician, school and a close friend, family member or neighbor, and keep them in an easy place to find in case they need them.
Keep signed copies of your nanny contract on hand. You and your nanny should each have a copy of the signed work agreement or nanny contract. This should include the agreed-upon pay, days and hours for work and any extra duties, such as agreed-upon housework, cooking, etc.


House rules
Make sure the nanny has necessary access. Your nanny needs their own set of house keys, as well as entry cards or passes to the school, community center or indoor play space that your family uses, if you want them to take the kids there.
Explain all housing operations. Make sure the nanny knows how to operate the heat/air conditioning, TV, washing machine, dishwasher and any other household appliances they may need to use. If you expect your nanny to be answering the phone a lot or taking messages, make sure they are aware. If your house is childproofed, demonstrate how toddler safety gates operate.
Lay out kitchen rules. Explain which dishes and kitchenware are OK to use if they are going to be doing any cooking.
Notify your nanny of expected visitors. Be sure your nanny is aware of any visitors you’re expecting each day. That includes lawn crews, pest control, pool cleaners or any other maintenance workers who may be around the house.
Detail all pet care. Does your nanny need to let any pets out to go to the bathroom, walk them or feed them? Is there any weird behavior to look out for, such as digging under or jumping fences or excessive barking? This goes especially for naptime when you don’t want the kids being woken up by loud animals.
Safety and health
Discuss allergies and intolerances. Remind your nanny of any allergies or particular food issues your children may have and whether there are any items of food that are off limits, like super-sugary items or your own stash of Rocky Road. For children with serious allergies, put food away that would be harmful them.
Be sure medicine is easily accessible. Show them where Benadryl, EpiPens or any other emergency allergy or asthma medicine is located. Go over all dosage requirements. Outline this on a paper you can hang in a visible location.
Go over bathing rituals for the kids. Explain things like which shampoo and soap to use, and remind them about safety concerns (i.e., experts advise that children 6 years or younger should not be unattended in a bathtub).
Explain the diaper and potty situation. If the nanny is changing diapers, tell them how often they should do it and what ointments to use, if any. If you are potty training, explain the routine again.
Set rules for playtime and naptime. Let the nanny know where it’s safe for the kids to play outside (if they can play unattended anywhere), and explain the rules for watching them on the swing set, trampoline or on their bikes. If the kids have set quiet time or naptime, let the nanny know so they can keep them on schedule.
Transportation
Explain all the specifics of your vehicle. If your nanny will be driving your kids, address specifics pertaining to your car. If it has a keyless ignition, computerized dashboard or GPS, make sure they are comfortable with it before you walk out the door. If you have car seats, show the nanny how they operate. A nice thing to do is to program your GPS with the addresses of school, the doctor’s office, dance class, soccer practice and the kids’ best friends’ homes. It may seem like a pain, but it’s easier than shouting directions over the phone while you’re at work.
Decide how gas will be paid for. If your nanny drives their own vehicle while on the job, you may want to include reimbursement in your nanny contract. If the nanny is driving your vehicle, make sure your gas tank is filled or provide them with a per diem for expenses.
Communicate any rules that pertain behind the wheel. Like, for example, texting or talking on the cell phone while driving is unacceptable. It’s not only unsafe, but it’s also illegal in most states.
Update your auto insurance. Your auto insurance plan should be updated to cover your nanny, if they’re going to be driving your car.
Daily schedule
Have a written protocol. For the first week, write down protocol until your nanny gets into a routine: School schedule, naps, classes and practices, extracurricular activities, meals, snacks and homework. Loop your nanny into the timing of things, such as when to be outside to catch the school bus, how long it may take on a busy morning to drive to school and how long it realistically takes your kid to get dressed and eat breakfast. As a general note, before you leave the house in the morning, you might want to give them a rundown of the day’s events, especially if there are changes to the routine.
Explain screen time rules. Clearly state rules for phone, TV and computer time in your house or else your 7-year-old daughter may convince your nanny that she never leaves for school without a full viewing of “Camp Rock 2.”
Set social media guidelines. Discuss how you’d like your nanny to handle their personal social media activity when they’re with your children. This includes whether or not you approve of them posting photos, videos or updates about your children.
Create a collaborative calendar. Consider making a shared calendar to refer to and encourage them to add to it as they get more comfortable. On the calendar, schedule regular check-ins with your nanny to go over any concerns that come up. A collaborative calendar app might be helpful.
Spread the word
Let everyone know about your new nanny. Alert your child’s school, your building’s doorman and friends about your new nanny and give them your nanny’s name. Most schools will not release your child to someone who is not on an authorized list.",https://www.care.com/c/your-nannys-first-day-of-work-checklist/
